I don't care about anything
\"Wake up, you should be roaming the streets of Hobart, hooking up with skateboarder dudes\"
\"You ain't shit\"
@Cswizzle__ okay! Facetime date tomorrow maybe??
@Cswizzle__ @lorentedwards I wasn't there, what are we learning 
At least life wants to fuck me
I'm so tired
My mom is sitting in the bathroom with me while I shower lol I hate my life
Today I tried getting into a car that wasn't even mine so that's how my day was lol
Nights like this I wish that the rain would fall..

I'm not the type to pull the first move so I guess I'll just have to wait this one out....
@ZAYgotGAME33 
Happy national boyfriend day @orourkeee1  http://t.co/kKOQuxexqQ
Having conversations with truly ignorant people is one of the most irritating things in the world.
If I accidentally sent you a funny vine, then I'm sorry but just enjoy it
I learned my lesson to never talk to a crown point kid ever again 
I've been texting someone for a good 2 hours thinking it was someone else....
I don't know how I slept, but I can't move my neck at all 
I love taking care of sick people 
@AliciaFaith96 so much more for you babes 
@NicKeil02 A for tazing me thanks nick
@NicKeil02 well sorry for trying to help
@NicKeil02 then go to the game
@NicKeil02 leave the room and find a party
Man I don't even care about anything anymore. You can fuck me over and be fake and I'm still just gonna chill.
Feel free to fall, you are a catch.
I have such great \"friends\" lol
It's not always a good thing to always see the best, even in the worst people.
@its_gio97 @lailani_mercado @h_ben_ told you 
@ktdumbauld still funny tho 
@ktdumbauld nooooo. New Years was by far the funniest

Everything I was scared of, ended up happening..
I give up
@tay_chitwood love you too 
@tay_chitwood nah don't lie boo
@tay_chitwood god you're so hot
I couldn't possibly me more annoyed of my life
What is even happening
I ripped my thong off during volleyball practice today so there's that
I'm so understanding and it's my biggest flaw because I'll let someone walk all over me just because I can sympathize for them..
I hate when I misspell a tweet and then have to retweet it correctly after it already got favorites 
I don't care about anything. At the end of the day it's still you, it's always you.
I said, \"No one has to know what we do,\" His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room.
I seriously hate this so much.
I feel sick to my stomach
@ktdumbauld and that's why I love you more than anything on this planet. You're my absolute fav 
But I just have to remind myself that Katie loves me and always wants me to succeed 
Feel even worse then I did before
@KBakaTHEBEST23 love ya Khy 
\"I hate you. I fucking hate you bitch.... Oh my god. No. I fucking love you. I fucking love you.\"
You'll never find another lover like me
@wayteasec then five guys 
@wayteasec chipotle 
Physically, mentally, and emotionally can not do school anymore.
I still dream about you
So long, bitch you did me so wrong, I don't wanna go on living in this world without you.
@NicKeil02 shush 
Don't blame your mistakes on others, just admit you're a shit person
@AnaKritikos I'm studying right now but it's very hard to study over material that you never understood in the first place 
Wish I had someone to tutor me in Chem, but I guess I'll just fail. Whateves
If I didn't have a volleyball game tomorrow I would just skip school
Want to sleep but have to study for this Chem 
My life is a joke
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness 
Don't even have the time or motivation to care
Used to wanna know how a freak taste.
I'm in your heart, I'm in your dreams, so fuck the world it's you and me.
@bobbicardwell I love you too 
Bobbi just said this reminds her of me... I'm worried  @bobbicardwell http://t.co/n3C9H2B5sL
I'm always a little to tired to care
In the end you cant always choose what to keep. You can only choose how you let it go.
People who believe in true love and marriage really make me question life
@ianflood21 I know 
@ianflood21 bro you're the fire master, just start one.
@fucktyler 
My day was going okay until now
That was probably the worst phone call of my life
Yes I'm watching Grease, don't judge.
Hopelessly devoted to you.
Seeing Jazlyn and Katie all in one week has made me feel 109099987x better about my shitty life 
@AliciaFaith96 hahahaha I love you more 
@AliciaFaith96 you might've actually said this before 
@AliciaFaith96 @TheFunnyTeens this couldn't be more accurate for you 
Me and Bobbi have the house to ourselves and are just eating mcdonalds and watching movies 
\"Bro, I'm pretty excited I get a 5 day weekend\"
You're a \"brainiac babe\"
\"That was more hardcore than porn\"
Currently lying half naked on my living room couch awaiting for Bobbi to arrive 
Can't even fucking handle my life
That's annoying
Have my house to myself all night and I'm just chilling by myself 
Can't believe my brother is gonna be 20 in less than an hour...
Each time I did something to push you away, I was terrified it would work
*sigh
Why is everything I watch somehow associated with my sad life 
@bobbicardwell @YouTube same dude, it honestly looks so good 
@YouTube @bobbicardwell
Skipping the homecoming game to watch ratatouille

Things just keep getting better and better

Prayers go out to my girl jaywill

Can't even describe how much I need you right now
Still can't find meaning in my life
I'll push you away and wonder why you never came back

So tempted to just say everything that I want to say
@Carson_Scotting anytime man 
@Carson_Scotting Wish you weren't private so I could retweet this 1,001 times

I'm not sure how I'm gonna be a tutor when I barely know anything myself.. 
@Jaay_Will okay haha 
@Jaay_Will oh yeah they're easy, they're just the one step version of the ones were doing now
@Jaay_Will in the homework or the other ones for the test?
@Jaay_Will I hope so 
@Jaay_Will at least we only have one of these problems on it 
@Jaay_Will that's the one I can't get either.. 
@Jaay_Will which one? I'm working on mine too 
@Jaay_Will are you talking about our homework?
I expected this from her, but not you

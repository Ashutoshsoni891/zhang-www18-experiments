Saturday with no plans. Should have went to work
Some things can't be unsaid
I love taking break with the iron workers. A 15 minute break turns into a 45 minute food and coffee run talking about coke binges and Molly
Co worker says he's eating healthy then 3 cookies and a doughnut later: \"Fuckin A god damnit I'm never gonna ever be fuckin thin\"
I really woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning. TGIF
\"Only 3 things people can't fuck with, touch, or talk about. You, Ryker and my civic\"- @caigels16 \n

Don't love a woman for her looks, love her for her personality. She has 10 so you can choose
Dude gets whacked in the face, bleeding, no one says a word. I ALMOST get bumped &amp; everyone's loosing their minds with worry. Annoying
I get the feeling that it's two against one. The mirrors a trigger and your mouths a gun

Seriously my co-workers need to stop supporting my caffeine addiction and supplying me with monsters daily lmfao 
I'm not so perfect baby are you worth it? I thought that you were different, but now I'm getting lifted, to mend my soul.
If you've never had to use a portapotty that's on uneven ground and moves when you're inside it, you don't know what fear is
I woke up this morning for work at the same time people were posting their \"going home from the bar\" mystories lol 
Decided to start off my morning with a little ghost pepper salsa

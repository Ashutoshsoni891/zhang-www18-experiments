For once I feel positive and motivated now to be a recovering alcoholic/sober alcoholic &lt;3
Also, I'm so happy how so many strangers clapped and cheered for me and hugged me. It was a great uplifting moment for me.
Last nights meeting was amazing. I almost cried. I got my first AA sobriety chip! This was a great step for me. I can do it! &lt;3
Such an exciting evening but yet I still feel so alone :(
Thunderstorm and raining like mad! I love  it! &lt;3
Today will be day 2! I can do it! :) #MakingChanges #staystrong
When it was my time to speak, I was gonna pass, but at the last second I decided to talk for a minute or so. And it actually felt so good :)
Went to my first AA meeting last night. Was so fucking nervous but it was actually pretty relieving.

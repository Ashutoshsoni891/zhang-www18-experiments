I've had more flat tires in the last year than in my whole life Jesus Christ
Biggest gain of the year for Ray Rice I suppose

I guess Lebron is the only pro athlete to give back this time of the year?!
#HereComesKoAndCo

Bob Duzyck loves pop music #kickit https://t.co/VvLI7igQP1
@ABEnenziaPore I like you man but you're fuckin crazy
Would Jonathan Martin have just walked off the field if a white D-Lineman \"bullied\" him during the game?
Is the \"n-word\" really even that big of a deal anymore?
@espn is unwatchable again now that the nba started. it's literally 80% of what they cover
@_Happy_Gilmore: NHL Power Rankings:\n1 Sharks\n2 Avalanche\n4- Ducks\n9- Halifax Highlanders\n27- Devils\nLOL- Flyers \nLMAO- Sabres\n@NHLFlyers
@_Happy_Gilmore: NHL Goal Leaders:\n1-Alex Ovechkin\n2-Patrick Marleau\n3-Sidney Crosby\n67-Charlie Conway\n987-Claude Giroux\n@NHLFlyers
@Stuckey2 Iowa is unwatchable as usual. Covering though
Iowa +9
The #Flyers are such a joke now it's so awesome #LetsGoPens
@Stuckey2 leafs are for real
John Lackey = Curt Schilling'Esque minus the blood of course
2 Power Hours done in a row I call that a pretty damn good night @DTF_Brian
The #Flyers fucking blow.
@SportsCenter: The NBA, NFL, NHL and MLB are all in session at once.\n\nLIFE. IS. GOOD.\n\nSurprised you knew the NHL was even going on
Every time I see a train speeding excessively I can't help but think of the movie Unstoppable
@wheelingprobs: These have to be the funniest father-son Halloween costumes I've ever seen: http://t.co/ZTQq4bAWFA @AWMartin31
How do you make a call like that with a minute left in the game? #LetsGoPens
Thad Lewis literally had as many fantasy points as Uncle Tom this week #cmonman
Beers on me and @RandyThe_SAVAGE til 6 and possibly later @Smitt_
#SorryCharlie
Lol at Flyers fans.
1-7 ouch #GoPens
@DTF_Brian @BizNasty2point0 @28CGiroux Giroux wishes. Simmonds got that goal. #BizNastyBestInTheWorld
@wheelingprobs: Taylor Hall just scored 2 goals in 8 seconds. Flyers haven't scored more than 2 goals in a 60-min hockey game. @NHLFlyers
#CryerNation
@knotEkarlie damn it I've been spelling it wrong for months!
Did Websters change the spelling of come to cum and I didn't know about it?
I know you're an alright person if you let me turn off Collinsburg Rd onto Main St while I'm slinging pizzas
Just heard Bob Duzyk say \"kick it\" lmao

Have not been this happy about a Pittsburgh sports team since 09 when the Penguins won the cup. It's surreal
Pirates punch their ticket. Now lets win out and get this NL Central crown
@MarkMaddenX who is blaming Ben ya big old cry baby
@MarkMaddenX lookin that way old timer
Anyone at the German Club watching this disgrace of a game?
Gotta catch the easy ones Brown. He was probably tired after walking 20 yards down field after his last catch
If you don't watch the Steelers when they're bad but love them when they go to the playoffs year after year you're probably not a real fan
@ashlizzm yeahhh. better watch what you're tweeting there best friend
So sick of stupid cat pictures on twitter
@MrRushelShell man I apologize for giving you shit for transferring. I now realize we will never need you at pitt #H2P
#H2P
@SidneyCrosbyEgo is my favorite twitter account hands down.  he's always on point
@MP_TheSack you mean kris letang?
Maybe Ronny Cedeno should have a Milk-Bone #milkbonerally #BUCN
@Grkmania and the GM would be like Tim Couch with Bernie Kosar as head coach
@Grkmania wouldn't the owner have to be a sexy broad then?
#LetsGoBucs
Well the Browns just completely proved me wrong by trading Richardson. Thought they had a decent team this year. Shoulda known better
@Leeshx11 don't do it. it will be worth it trust me!
On the bright side the Cardinals lost
@MisterMcJacob just gettin this rust off our gears for some solid hockey tweets between us this season
@MisterMcJacob which one? all 3 pittsburgh teams looking putrid tonight haha
2nd week in a row Eli got more fantasy points than Uncle Tom and I had him on my bench. He scored 2 more pts and i lost by 1.5 #smh

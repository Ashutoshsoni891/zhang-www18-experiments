Seriously can't believe you fucking stalk me on here....
Winning http://t.co/mKgbxODtY5
Closet full of clothes and I still have nothing to fucking wear
White grape juice is the shit
Or at least Blaire does... Every time I take a video of her she loves to watch it over and over again
I feel like kids will have more vivid memories of their toddler years than we did b/c they watch videos of themselves on our phones a lot..
@BrittDeJesus_ omg! That's like my almost 2 year old - she already knows how to work my kindle!
@soulfulvixson agreed!
@soulfulvixson I MISS YOU!
I can wear my hello kitty slippers, guitar hero pajama pants, pink carhartt and smoke a bogie in peace... And not embarrass myself 
Sometimes I hate where I live but it's so nice with like no neighbors and all woods... It's peaceful.
 http://t.co/nKceUBYqDv
My anxiety attacks have been so bad recently. Literally my legs go numb &amp; I throw up constantly.
Everyday, Blaire takes her toothbrush and brushes all her stuffed animals teeth. It's too cute 
@justmejudesss miss and love you beautiful!
14 degrees today, 51 tomorrow.
What the hell is wrong with girls these days
Blaire didn't touch her earrings the whole first year, now she won't stop taking them out &amp; I'm pretty sure they closed up 
Blaire sleeping next to me has got to be the best feeling ever. She's just so cuddly. I'm beyond lucky.
Alex asked me what my favorite color roses are.. I told him black. His response was, \"oh of course, so they match your fucking heart\" 
Story time with the babe. She picks out the same 4 stories every single night 
Sometimes you gotta zig while everyone else is zagging  http://t.co/tvdmSqopZ6

My daughter dips her cheese in ranch and ketchup.... Yup.
Since Blaire insists on drawing on the tv, walls and our kindle, I think Santa is gonna be brining her an easel for Christmas
Blaire is a psycho just like me. The girl has no fear and a pain tolerance higher than half the dudes I know.

Sad to say but the things I would do for a crunch wrap supreme right now are disgusting.
Tailgating with my work family tomorrow starting at 9am. This should be interesting.
If I don't go to bed with blaire when I put her down, then it takes me forever to get to sleep.

If YOU'RE gonna insult someone, please  spell shit right. YOU'RE embarrassing.

If you can eat 4 slices of pizza, we can be friends.
Alex and I came to an agreement today that you're suppose to get fat in the winter. So eating pizza, wings &amp; fries everyday is acceptable.

Blaire is out shopping for the day with grandma and it's 65 degrees out. Sounds like a perfect opportunity to day-drink with the boy 
Before I start to blow dry my hair I whip my head around in like 20 circles... It like pre-dries my hair.
I use visine even when I don't just smoke... It just makes me eyes this really nice white 
@haleyandaddison thank you! I sit on the ledge next to it and my feet just chill in the sink. Lmao
Does anyone else practically sit in the sink when doing their makeup? I like to be super close to the mirror...
Okay, I'm done. Everyone can carry on with their lives now.
I was not a good student but some of you make me look smart AF.
Can you please date for like a month AT LEAST before getting a house together. Y'all stupid AF.
Every mom, all around the world should stop whatever their doing at this exact second, and just take a nap. Let's just do it.
Blaire is throwing the biggest fit because I won't let her wear her chucks.... She's a size 6, their a 4. Do you see the struggle?
Don't mind the mess or my pjs but I check my stomach fat everyday &amp; look who started copying me... http://t.co/UV87La6Y0R
Sometimes when Blaire whines for no reason I cover my ears and say \"Blaire, this is so unnecessary\"
@mommyandhadley omg jordan..... Never again please 
It's funny how so many people who think they know me, know nothing at all. And I bet if they did, they wouldn't blame me for being so cold.
Girls apparently always have a problem with losing bobbipins. See, I never lose mine... Their all just bent from using them for my bowl.
Annnnnnnd now he just unliked it. You officially look like a creep now sir.
Now since it's colder outside, I rearranged my bedroom so the bed is right next to the window. Now I don't need to move to smoke my bowl 
@tiffanym_xo to top it off, it's this girls boyfriend and I beat her ass in a bar on my 21st

Do people really still have ask.fm? why peopleeee WHYYYY
Blaire has this new weird obsession with sticking the baby monitor down her pants
Bipolar bitch right hereeeeeee
It amazes me how angry I can get in two seconds, over nothing.
I really enjoy a lot of my \"mom friends\" on both sites, don't get me wrong... But chilllll with this shit - idgaf about your confessions.
Like, what?
I can't imagine being like \"oh, sorry I can't go on a date Mondays past 9 cause I have to post confessions for other girls\".................
Some of you moms need a life. Instagram and twitter shouldn't be as important as you make it out to be. You ladies need more hobbies.
@xoxo_bekah at least you have an excuse! And yours isn't fat. Plus, it looks good! Lol

@PostGradStoners 
I'm either sweating or freezing
Seriously thinking about asking Alex to pick me up a Gatorade on the way home so I can add some vodka to it - I'm sure that'd numb my throat
In and out of sleep alllll day. I can't eat anything.. Except bags on bags of halls (which do jack shit by the way)
A little green is a different story...
My throat hurts so bad that I've had zero desire to smoke a cig today... Maybe this is a way to quit!
Alex has work till 10 &amp; I'm currently cuddled up in his bed about to take a nice 6 hour nap w/ no interruptions or little fingers up my nose

All I wanna do is curl up in Alex's bed and sleep all day long..
Omg my throats so bad 
Alex always hates me in the morning, I'm always poking him and climbing all over him  the kid doesn't wake up till 1... It's 6:15
My glands are so swollen that my neck looks fat. I literally feel like garbageeee

Me and my mom fight every single day. It's probably the unhealthiest relationship.

Always have a case on my phone.. Go out one night without it on &amp; I now have about 15 scratches, 8 indents &amp; about 4 chunks missing.
Carried around a crown royal bag last night as my pocketbook. It actually worked quite well
Fuck it's 3:30 and I'm so hungover already
Should I go to the psu tailgate after work or should I not .... hmmmm hard decision.
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer

Like a little possessed child haha she always does this glare and it's like her head down but eyes staring up &amp; it's scary... It just is 
My monitor screen turns off to save battery &amp; I'm not gonna lie I get scared thinking about turning it on &amp; blaire standing in front of it 
@AlyssaHelm they hate you too Eliza  
I am sittin' on the clouds, I got smoke coming from my seat. I can play basketball with the moon, I got the whole world at my feet.
My mom got me these cute gloves from Alaska &amp; my hands have ever been warmer.
And then she sleeps till 8am..
People would always tell me about sleep schedules and blah blah blah. I never did that shit &amp; look how well she turned out.
Blaire is so good. You can just lay her in her crib around 12 &amp; 8:30 and she just passes out. No standing up, no fussing, nothing 
lol fuck you

Fuck it, I'm making pizza

I just love food so much
Do I actually attempt sleep or do I get up and make Ellios pizza.... The struggle is real
Twitter, Facebook &amp; Instagram really aren't that interesting yet I'm still awake creepin on all of them.
So funny how 64 motherfuckers watch my snap story but 2 of them actually snap me. 
People smoke e-ciggs to help try &amp; quit. I smoke e-ciggs so I don't have to leave my bed at night 
But knowing I have to get up in just 6 short hours for work is the worst.
Curling up in bed is actually the best feeling.
I either love you or I fucking hate you. There's no in between. Choose wisely.

And this headache can go away now..
I feel so alone
Blaire has this new obsession with taking her diaper off  .. why!
Messy mom bun  http://t.co/BbUJuVAKjp
Sounds awesome

The medication I'm being put on is suppose to be very effective but if you miss a day it feels like you're withdrawing from heroin
My obsession for Cheetos started when I was pregnant.. &amp; now I know why. #cheesehead http://t.co/fOY1ihNdgl
Slightly obsessed. http://t.co/hKNg2K2MdL
Whenever someone asks what my favorite color is and I respond with \"black\", they give me this look like I'm satan or something.
It's the simple things in life... Like rolling the windows up &amp; down. http://t.co/MDUv5oLJYU

I was raped in 2011 by a Hispanic dwarf &amp; he was charged 'not guilty' yesterday. This world is so fucked up. http://t.co/EBBnVS0GQT
@kelsey_bahner tell me about it.. 
@kelsey_bahner thank you love  I appreciate it 
@kelsey_bahner last years trial it was a hung jury, 11 people said guilty &amp; 1 said not-guilty. It got violent bet the jury &amp; was cut short.
@kelsey_bahner yea, I never bring it up but I was roofied/raped back in 2011 by a townie Hispanic midget in Williamsport when I went to pct
Day 1 of my rape re-trial. Hopefully the last time I will have to be re-living this.

@PCTKeepItClassy cause I saw someone's tweet about how everyone has this secret bond... But no. It's not like that at all.
You think that's sad or heartless? Nope! It's called drama-free and don't have to share 
I sometimes even forget I didn't make blaire by myself..
Thanks for Blaire but i never loved you &amp; I never will.. Ya piece of shit  He never comes up in conversation and he never crosses my mind.
I honestly believe I'm the only person in the world who doesn't have that \"unspoken bond/love crap\" with their baby daddy.
Blaire is literally ALL me. Even down to her big toe. It's like God knew I didn't wanna see her dad ever again 
First day off in forever, time to enjoy the fair with my mini

I say this everyday but pizza and ranch literally is the bomb.
I love you  http://t.co/SudHaAdAJ0
@alyssdanielle @djproph3t right?! 
I'm always starving. Even when I'm full as fuck and can't stand to look at food, I'll close my eyes and continue to stuff my face.
@Way2Irrational lmao oh  well I disagree! Age is just a number! &amp; you know me, I do what I want! Lol in this case, I guess who I want lmao
@Way2Irrational lmaoooo I can't even figure out how to do this 
@adeleon92 ahhhhh! It's crazy! Time really does fly now!
Blaire is 2 in less than 5 months. Are you shitting me?!
If you're lonely, it'll radiate off you &amp; look like desperation. So, be careful.
Overthinking and overanalyzing get you NOWHERE. I promise you, you WILL ruin something over NOTHING.
Everybody loves Raymond &amp; Friends are two shows that never fail to make me laugh

I'm horrible at painting my nails.
Can't find any of my nailpolish which is scary considering have 100+ so I had to use this purple I found in my moms room. Purple is not me.
A huge hummingbird came to the porch &amp; I said, \"oh my god\"... 5 seconds later, blaire, who's playing quietly goes, \"oh my god\" and laughs
I think my hair would look good in a sockbun but I don't even know how to curl my hair with a curling iron never mind roll it in a sock.
I really should start doing my nails more often. Their chipped 90% of the time. And by chipped I mean theirs more nail showing than polish.
I decided to put animal crackers in my pocket after smoking a face blunt last night &amp; I woke up to Blaire finding them in bed &amp; eating them
I really need to stop eating like a 40-year-old obese man
@jilly_bo_filly 
I just ate wayyy too much chocolate

Happy Sunday  http://t.co/CLqvJBZmuX
That \"ignoring each other\" game can turn into \"never hearing from me again\" game reaaaaaaaaal fast.
I literally only eat junk food. Blaire loves healthy food. Maybe she'll convert me.
Clueless is my favorite movie of all time

@tristyykay I'll just sit her ass in time out like the child she is
@tristyykay haha not for a long time. She's bitter. Her relationship is just to "hurt" me and she runs to Ben's inbox when she realizes idc
@tristyykay this girl named Jodie who thinks I care about her relationship &amp; some thot named Chelsey who wants to be a sidekick
Ya'll know those text where it looks like the guy replies but it's really the girlfriend? That happened to me &amp; I'm still laughing
I'd never stay with a man who cheated, you've got me all kinds of fucked up.
Done protecting my tweets, imma let these bitches be bothered
LOL SHUT UP NO ONE CARES ENOUGH TO STALK YOUR TWITTER. We just have people who report to us without us asking. Don't feel special hoe.
@c_atkinsss01 BOP
@c_atkinsss01  way to put me out there. I told her i'd be grown &amp; we could talk first. Can't have anymore tammy's.
The things ben sends me on instagram... what?  https://t.co/wu723oSNmQ
OMG https://t.co/JCGzBRByWG
I ignore hundreds of guys a day (not exaggerating) for a guy who ignores me.  lol cool shit.
If you can't ever text me first then we won't talk, simple as that
@trin_kay just say "move bitch, get out the way" and then they may find someone else to bother
This is what I'm that last text @c_atkinsss01 https://t.co/wa4UDFipXA
Everyone's like "why do you wear make up, you look the same with/without it" well I feel like I look like a 12 yr old little girl w/o it
@kaaymccoy every time I hear "foreign" I think of chase at forest asking "what foreign girl was in your passenger seat?"
All of my friends are dressing up as the purge for Halloween &amp; we refer to it as the real thing.. "what are you gonna wear for the purge?"
@KGearheardt I'm dying
It's okay to not be okay.

@kmichellekiser is the best person ever
I hate the "we break up and delete everything off social media" type people. Like you loved him/her yesterday, put that shit back up.
Feeling needed &amp; wanted by the same person that you need &amp; want is one of the best feelings in the world.

@JordenPulliam  tell me why I feel the same way about mustard

My friends still have the nerve to say "here" or "close" when they aren't... like I have your location bitches
It's the end of September &amp; I'm just now doing my first Halloween event.. I know that's normal for most, but I've been ready since July

@swood_s you coming over tonight?
@BaiDeBrosse13 when are you gonna come around &amp; be my partner in crime?
So ready to get home, clean my room, do some hair &amp; have girl time
@swood_s last night
It's impossible to "take things slow" with someone you've been with before.
I don't even have a boyfriend
A bouncer said "if you don't leave I'll pick you up &amp; carry you out" and I said "and my boyfriend will beat your ass" &amp; he walked a away
Really just considering being a playboy bunny. This basic ass life style isn't for me.
"You're truly beautiful, you've just got to pick a guy to be loyal to and love"
Forever posting pictures of this night bc it went perfect (Didn't even get kicked out until 30 till last call) https://t.co/tnfNlY8zDL

Who would of thought Jeremy would be the one to talk me out of a fight. Thanks to hank for having my back tho trying so hard to be grown rn
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.

@Sierrrarose__ @miraaaaaaanduh @lysssa_oxox
"Why'd you follow my friend""My phone spazzed &amp; I accidentally ended up on her page &amp; hit follow"
Confused on why bitches are always worried about what I'm doing.
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you.
Go upstairs to make food... come back &amp;..... @Doctor_Bre https://t.co/qtY4X9lBh7

@mayganrenae I will never get used to perms, EVER. But weirdly it bothers me more when someone else does one verses when I do one myself.
@mayganrenae it just lingers too. So not mixing with my hangover
Confused why this lady chose today to get a perm. The smell is not working with me today
Pretty sure I remember Dre shoving an Advil down my throat at 6 this morning &amp; it didn't help shit bc I feel like death

Being with someone who's already had a first love is scary. I like the reassurance of being the first.
I know it ain't my birthday, but I'm about to put on my birthday suit &amp; call it a night.
@swood_s I know baby, I know. But everything happens for a reason.. I'm here whenever you need me
Ass fat, yeah I know.

No idea who this even is honestly, but obviously i shouldn't answer  https://t.co/wBdZPjWL5E
I had this nightmare that i used 100% of my data &amp; still had 10 days left till it renewed
When i get mad I seriously just sit there and think of all the things i could break &amp; it's honestly an issue
When ben got out of bed for work Jax woke up and said "have a good day ben, i love you" in his baby morning voice &amp; it was so effin cute
It isn't fair that moms are full time &amp; dads are part time, or vice versa. The other parent shouldn't just be a baby sitter.
Whenever someone tells me to get off my phone i just want to text them saying "shut up"
Exactly  https://t.co/oPVxTwxleE
people need to stop making excuses for their mistakes and start apologizing.
So ready for this change in my life
@DLuccc  omg i caught pikachu last night after you left!
Babes https://t.co/6WrVCz2PnF

We don't get mad, we get even
@tristyykay no clue, i thought they were in ben's car but i checked when he got home &amp; they are no where to be found
@tristyykay I seriously cleaned this whole house today looking for my keys

@Delovpierce_  i showed up at his work like boy you better charge that phone.
Ben's phone died while he was at work so i moved out of the house for the day. #extrapetty

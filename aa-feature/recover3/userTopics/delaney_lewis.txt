Being drunk with best friends is the best kind of drunk..  http://t.co/NbqaYtZlPq
@Sassy_Drunk: My hobbies include drinking wine and disappointing people. This is literally my life spelled out in words.
My bed never felt so good.
@im_JOE_kin: @delaney_lewis you are perfect. Hah, no I'm not, but thank you!
@JennaLee_15 @mbsanchez10 who knew I could make it across the dance floor in record time. So intense I had to shower, 
It must be who's gonna take on the challenge of grinding with Phil night. @JennaLee_15 &amp; @mbsanchez10 threw me under the bus on that one. 
@AyJayKay8 fuck the dealer, aka fuck Delaney..
@JennaLee_15: Delaneys new card game is the reason why I'm so fucked up. So yeah. Blame that slut I love you 
I could eat Subway every day of my life.
@Kyle_Rodgers_  thinks I go home and read the bible at night.. 
My favorite hobby is laying in bed.
@NickShawley @Kyle_Rodgers_  you guys are nasty. This is why we don't hang out with you.
@NickShawley @Kyle_Rodgers_ Shut the hell up. No you're not!
@NickShawley @Kyle_Rodgers_ we do exist. We are trying to make cupcakes!
@Kyle_Rodgers_ fuck off. We are the best you ever had. 
@Kyle_Rodgers_ @kenzieobrien13 you guys are lazy as hell. They're coming.
@im_JOE_kin Maybe I'll come in a little, who's over there?!
I don't think my father, the inventor of toaster strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
All I know is that one of us is right and the other one is you.
@Majjy_MajjDOe @niC00LeST0RYBR0 @haleee_xo Everyone counts on the bang bros. Can't believe you left us, Majj 
@DavidEaton10 oh my gosh me too! When's it coming out? It's like the best one and only has two seasons..
@niC00LeST0RYBR0 @haleee_xo you aren't even in the country and you know where the parties are at. 
@DavidEaton10 Grey's, Dexter, Friends, HIMYM, Prison Break, Walking Dead, OITNB, Breaking Bad. ...
People who are just as obsessed with Grey's as I am are my favorite kind of people..
Some days I just wanna stay in bed and watch Netflix and by some days, I mean every day.
Running on 2 1/2 hours of sleep. 
Just hit a chicken on the interstate. W&amp;J adventures never seize to amaze me.
If you want one fucked up Clarion girl, you get two.  @kenzieobrien13
@EricSpehalski @AndrewGrimone @tylerwigfield Drew's future is looking bright.
@tylerwigfield Me either. Brought a notebook, but no pencil to accompany it..
Already considering dropping my 9:30 because it's too damn early.
Wiz Khalifa is the weirdest looking human ever.
I think I have this flaw where I always find the people that will cause me the most pain in my life and pick them.
So don't let me down. You make those promises, don't take em back now.
@J_Tummi @Kyle_Rodgers_ @NickShawley  I wasn't! I was just trying to eat my cereal &amp; you guys were screaming. You sounded fantastic!
@NickShawley @Kyle_Rodgers_ haha you're good. You guys have some lovely singing voices, lemme tell ya!
Someone in @NickShawley and @Kyle_Rodgers_ apartment is hard core jammin right now.. #thinwalls
I literally can't do anything right. So done.
@andeee_o &amp; I will try with every rhyme to come across like I am dying to let you know you need to try to think. 
Why be sober when you can be drunk?
@its_nunz totally worth getting up and going outside for. Good call. 
Never confuse attention for affection.
I know everything happens for a reason, but sometimes I wish I knew what that reason was.
Leggings and yoga pants might be one of the best thing that's ever happened to me.
When the sadness outweighs the happiness, it's time to let go.
@mikloss71 hahahhaha this is great, but I'd go with the third one. Ugly. I hate you. 
Finding out that @mads_richardson and I get to celebrate the same birthday weekend is so excited for us , yet so bad for our livers.
You can't make someone treat you right, but you can make them wish they did.
@girlposts: Happy birthday to the hottest 49 year old out there  http://t.co/EpxU1V9u3Y @kenzieobrien13 it's our boyfriends birthday
Huge Turn On: When people smell good and are hot. Sometimes spicy. Wrapped in tinfoil. Are actually burritos.
We didn't realize we were making memories, we just knew we were having fun.  http://t.co/VhqMEzOLik
When @kileylewis was little, she used to throw tantrums and smash her head off of the concrete sidewalks outside.
When @kileylewis was little, she used to throw tantrums and smash her head off of the concrete sidewalks outside.
@SGuisto wait, weird. like 3 randoms just followed me. I think you read my mind..
I miss your smile, but I miss mine a little more.
@Mark_da_Spark20 I always find that cutting it is always a good solution for this problem, but maybe that's just me..
@JVokes_ I'll build a snowman with you, Jul.  he can hold a basketball and wear Lins's beanie. Cutest snowman ever. 
Happy birthday to my slut From eating chalk to our drunk nights, you'll always be my babe. Love you @thatslindsey  http://t.co/I2qHxJdeaK
I literally let people treat me however they want.
She loved three things- a joke, a glass of wine, and a handsome man.  http://t.co/h86pgzw1ph
It's not the goodbye that hurts, it's the flashbacks that follow.
\"Sometimes surviving is all the living I can handle.\" -P.Sawyer.
cute date idea: take me to sephora you stay outside of the store and wait. @kelseyelewis
I don't understand how people don't like college. It's like independently living with your best friends 24/7.
Forgive people for what they have done, but don't forget what they are capable of doing.
Putting a sports bra on alone right after you get out of the shower takes some serious skill.
@niC00LeST0RYBR0 I'm so jealous. Take me with you 
Wait. I miss shaking it out on the dance floor all weekend with @mads_richardson  is it January 20th yet? 
Kinda miss you, kinda wanna punch you.
@kenzieobrien13 so road trip to Grove City the first day of class or....
@ashleymarie320 everyone going back and here I am with 2 weeks left ... 
The worst kind of sad is not even being able to explain why.
My heart is whole with these girls. Handcuffs are fun, but my girls are more fun.  http://t.co/frbgs4KLbb
@JennaLee_15 I LOVE IT 
My #1 talent is letting people treat me horribly and still keeping them around.
GUYS. I GET TO SEE MY NUMBER ONE SLUTS TODAY. @kenzieobrien13 &amp; @JennaLee_15 
@kenzieobrien13: oh ok @delaney_lewis http://t.co/8eXUK1XtBz hahhah well I personally think my logic is spot on..
Happy Birthday to my homegirl, @awalls8  I hope you have a fantastic day cupcake! Can't wait to be back with you!  http://t.co/AEc02xiyQ1
New Years kiss with a bottle of alcohol: 
I just said fucker to my sister and she said \"Woah you fuck her. You brought her.\" 
In need of a new ink.
@PaigeWhitney78 @oliviafragale \"Ayye, you good B?\"  I'm dead. So funny. 
vodka might not be the answer, but it sure as hell makes you forget the question.
@JennaLee_15 I miss my girlfriend 
and suddenly, everything changed in the blink of an eye.
Caring is so overly exhausting nowadays.
They don't miss you when you're gone. They miss you when you're doing better.
@linn21_ awe I miss you too, Lins 
Home is where the pants aren't.
S/O to @KacieNicholee for showing up the guys last night and getting me out of the mud
All I'm trying to do is figure out who's worth my time and who's not.
@mads_richardson those first weekends http://t.co/jIbcW4VnV6
Don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory. Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey.
@kenzieobrien13: rumor has it @delaney_lewis is coming to town  I can't wait to spend the day with you 
@LoganClingan: Can't wait to see the ball drop with my bitchezzzz @delaney_lewis @thatslindsey can't wait babe ..
@RandyJr_D9 hahaha I  like u.
Sometimes I drink water just to surprise my liver.
My mistake began the day I started trusting the bullshit coming out of your mouth.
Don't forget to wish this pretty girl a happy birthday today! Love you so much @brooke_burfield  http://t.co/y4NbJ4vmmb
My chiropractor makes me feel some type of way
Sometimes it's better to be mature and react with no reaction.
I've changed so much in the past two years that sometimes I don't even recognize myself.
My gosh do I miss being tan.
@JohnReidTheBC maybe, or do you just not like it enough..
\"This is life. Bad things happen. It's hard, but you find your people. You find your person and you lean on them.\" -Grey's Anatomy
I can't tell you what I'm thinking because half the time I don't even know.
Happy birthday to the beautiful, @MeganDurante  have a good day! 
The face I give my parents 99% of the time caught on camera.  http://t.co/QGCwqiQS3a
I love a good challenge.
I swear I see @JennaLee_15 naked and in nudes more I see myself naked..
My lifeproof case has a one-year warranty. Yeah, okay. That definitely makes sense.
Oh my god, look at that face. You look like my next mistake.
@kileylewis oh my gosh. I completely missed the end. Is that when they are talking to those guys in the truck?!
@kileylewis Why did you do this to me. That's so creepy.. 
Ready to be back with partner in crime http://t.co/0cLEnQ61EH
I like my coffee how I like myself: dark, bitter, and too hot for you. 
My encouragement to fight through my finals Dr.McDreamy here I come  http://t.co/LN6R6G5AuZ
@titruma24 how many stories so you suggest? I was thinking a solid 4-5.
@cameronhorning miss you CamBear 
These finals got me about ready to quit school or jump off a roof, not sure which one yet.
50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of pizza deliveries end in happiness. #teampizza
One of those types of weekends with my favorites.  http://t.co/5C7n4JQslx
and let the week of hell begin  #finals
@mikloss71 @allimarie_21 no, no, no   team Mik all the way.
In my happiest state when I'm with my babes  http://t.co/arDYI6MAiq
@GuistoKendyl have fun babe  so jealous!
Taking personal days from college is one of my better choices in life 
@KacieNicholee I saw a sock in the parking lot today ..
@awalls8:You know it's a good day when @delaney_lewis actually cooks her chicken nuggets instead of eating them frozen\"I was feeling risky
@ashleymarie320 tempting.. what day, Saturday after the game?! 
Coolest college kids ever.  http://t.co/WQgdNA6lIi
@CasssidyFord: College: kind of want to drop out, kind of want to stay forever, kind of pissed I can't do both my exact feelings 
It's December 1st, which means the 25 days of Christmas starts today 
Happy birthday @kadelogue 
@kileylewis this feeling is all too often and well known for me..
@markstrothers20 and you're black. What are we getting at here?
I love when the car in front of me speeds because then it's less likely that I'll get caught.
People are so damn confusing.
Happy birthday to this beautiful gem. Miss your ditzy self so much, @bri2016. Love you babe  have a good day! http://t.co/VlbioKWUS3
Happy Birthday @andeee_o 
@Majjy_MajjDOe you're the best, Majj 
I'm a strong person, but it wouldn't hurt to have someone to turn to on my worse days..
Maybe it's this expectation though, of wanting to be happy that just keeps us from ever getting there. -Grey's Anatomy
So thankful for my high school and college friends both for putting up with me. I love you all. 
If you have to convince yourself it's fine, it's probably not.
@LoganClingan @thatslindsey  what day are you guys free?!
Every time we reunite, we pick up right where we left off like nothing has changed.
@markstrothers20 this is a one time expectance. Don't let it happen again. 
@mads_richardson make sure you give her your present! 
Nobody's gonna feel your pain when all is done and it's time for you to walk away.
@DuncanBrode oh you shut your mouth and go buy a new pair of \"soft jeans\" without crotch holes to kidnap your wife in.
Watch out ladies, @DuncanBrode is looking to kidnap one of you and make you his future wife..
I will try with every rhyme to come across like I am dying, to let you know you need to try to think.
@markstrothers20 go fuck yourself.
Words can't describe how excited I am to go on a break from school. Everything is so much simpler at home.
@Lakin_Aunkst be right there baby 
@julielogue1 I will. I hope they stay as well. Thanks for the heads up!
My roommates and I are going insane acting like we are in a life or death situation while stuck on the interstate.. 
@andeee_o you should ALWAYS be happy cause you're gorgeous.
Never put the key to your happiness in someone else's pocket.
@jessiemccool I'm at the movies right now too...I'm in theater 6 
@jessiemccool where are you right now 
Swiping a card is so much easier than giving away cash and that's where my shopping problem begins.
Forever in love with @fitgirlfuel skilled action shots of her pouring milk into her cereal on Insta.
If it's gonna be cold outside, I need Christmas.
@mads_richardson thanks mads, love you 
Sometimes nights I feel like I really have my whole life together, and then other nights I feel like I couldn't get anymore stressed.
@brooke_burfield this was always a struggle  lets go to the games together this year! ..
One of the harder things about being a girl in winter is that if you enter the cold with wet hair, your hair will form it's own icicles..
I might be as much of a basic white girl as they come. I'm proudly in love with my NorthFace, Yogas, Uggs, and Starbucks.
@egourley12 @markstrothers20 Mark, you can have her. She's too sleazy &amp; easy for me
@egourley12 @markstrothers20  luv u.
@markstrothers20 @egourley12 is still single and ready to mingle.
@_CollegeHumor_: current mood: http://t.co/AVRq3TvY1p
I spend more time stressing over my work than the time I spend actually doing it..
@kbaby_hanes hahahha I hate you. It wasn't on purpose!
I don't mind pretty, fluffy snow, but this slushy, rainy bullshit has gotta go.
I am forever mind fucked on the concept of time change..
My dad's annual Sunday text to me:Hey Nast, the walking dead is on tonight at 9, but I want you to remember that it's not real.. #thanksdad

@JennaLee_15: I wish Mackenzie and Delaney loved me I love you more than anything babeee
I caved and bought a homeless man subway. He said \"God bless your soul. You may have just saved my life.\" Brb while I cry..
I'll always be there for you and I hate myself for that.
I wish I could take my college friends home with me over break.
@M_Pillot and I love you 
Rock bottom became the solid foundation where I rebuilt my life.
@egourley12 cuz you're ugly
Maybe I've met the right person, but I'm just not ready to fall in love yet.
@gracieloohoo24 love you baconator  keep your head up!
I didn't realize that when I payed a fortune to live here, I'd even get a bonus of having thin walls so I can hear my neighbors every move..
@Majjy_MajjDOe Not me, hahha but I meant the one I usually don't mind are even a struggle lately!
Attending every single class lately is a struggle.
@JennaLee_15 uh,I never thought I would hear those words come out of your mouth. I'll get a thermometer &amp; some medicine. Feel better babe

@FunnyComedianz: You had one job? http://t.co/KHAFz1pil6 @thatslindsey .....
@M_Pillot I let myself in and made them. I apologize.
because what else would we do on this fine Thursday other than play catch with eggs and pumpkins in our kitchen? @kenzieobrien13
These last few weeks before break are going to be a struggle.
@BrennaElainee my bed needs you.
@BrandonBlose12 @AlldayTPhil @YungLordMoose hahahha yes. I'm her roommate. I didn't follow anyone of you though.. 
@JennieFragale I'm so glad you're you..

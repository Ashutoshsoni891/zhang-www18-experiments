@Iheartnoise oh hail yes
@Iheartnoise something about being very sweaty and kind of unable to breathe pairs quite nicely with minimal harsh music.
@dammit_d4ve does creating heavy music count? 
@dammit_d4ve might be able to in like, two days. Need some motherfucking protein STAT.
@Iheartnoise Khanate was for winding down in the sauna. Positively blissful.
99.9% certain that this bitch was the only person working out to Swans and Khanate in succession.
@Iheartnoise @kenk666 y'all should also check out Hair Police and Nautical Almanac. Proud yo say I hosted all three at my old venue 
@kenk666 enjoy!! Wolf Eyes are one of my favorite bands of all time. Caught them live more times than I can count. 
@kyleantivenin @MetalShayne2000 @JeffTreppel @EZSnappin loud foals? https://t.co/8SeL6hCcQA
@kenk666 those three pretty much cover the different vibes ranging from chill to maniacal.
@kenk666 actually start with Dread, then Dead Hills, then Burned Mind.
@kenk666 start with Dead Hills.
@chris_redar @Scrapyardzine @pseudopseudo @jshstew @OldThunderMetal I rode everywhere in PA, too scared to do it in NYC :/
@Scrapyardzine @pseudopseudo @chris_redar @jshstew @OldThunderMetal just logged 11 miles on the bike, now off for one hour private sauna.
@jshstew @chris_redar @Scrapyardzine @pseudopseudo @OldThunderMetal three!
@MannyOWar Manny, not every state can be as culturally magnificent or liberally minded like NYC.
@Scrapyardzine @pseudopseudo @chris_redar @jshstew @OldThunderMetal 
@pseudopseudo @chris_redar @jshstew @Scrapyardzine @OldThunderMetal especially after blacking out for awhile. Sauna will rule after!
@WritersofColour @_JUCIFER_ @IshaSesayCNN this od about the saddest thing. Like, why didn't any Germans say anything before the Holocaust?!
@chris_redar @jshstew @Scrapyardzine @OldThunderMetal @pseudopseudo today is the day I ended my 36-day bender and finally going to the gym 
@MetalShayne2000 \"PIMENTO OR BISQUE?! DOESNT MATTER MUCH TO ME, AS LONG AS YOU PAAAAY.\"
@VoidRitual I'm a little bit freaking out that this means January will be absolutely and unbearably frigid. Fingers cross'd!
@VoidRitual it's been a steady 66 here for the past couple weeks. Can't complain.
@ObsidianHyoid I put these poor kids through such aural torture. Glad you are also doing the devil's work across the pond! 
I'm almost sorry for how many times my coworkers had to listen to Houdini today. Almost. https://t.co/72vJVm3tcX 
What a time to be a life
Legitimately concerned. https://t.co/W5exNMbXer
@CelticFrosty @JTiloveTX @GregAbbott_TX @BarackObama like, dude, exposing your citizens to fucking guns everywhere also puts them in peril.
@chris_redar @MannyOWar @metaltxt @jaci_KVLT @FVS_Metalhead I assume you mean a Mikey's Coffee Stand?
@MannyOWar @jaci_KVLT @metaltxt @FVS_Metalhead (oh, I did once throw up in it. Als my cat did too.)
@chris_redar @MannyOWar @metaltxt @jaci_KVLT @FVS_Metalhead worked at one of those too. Now THAT was a fantastic job. Free Booze Daily.
@MannyOWar @jaci_KVLT @metaltxt @FVS_Metalhead however too embarrassed to take it to a place and show the carnage that it lived through.
@MannyOWar @jaci_KVLT @metaltxt @FVS_Metalhead well, I mean, four years of shows and tours... I still have it and would like to get it fixed
@MannyOWar @jaci_KVLT @metaltxt @FVS_Metalhead (I have a Balenciaga handbag which was a gift and I totally destroyed it )
@jaci_KVLT @MannyOWar @metaltxt @FVS_Metalhead 'but hold the Balenciaga and, if I could, a little extra standing room on the F'
@MannyOWar @metaltxt @jaci_KVLT @FVS_Metalhead  my point is that generally wealthy people also come with a sense of entitlement.
@MannyOWar @metaltxt @jaci_KVLT @FVS_Metalhead  txt can stay, and of course not everyone who shops at Barney's is entitled.
@MannyOWar @FVS_Metalhead Worked at the real Barney's for a spell. Also Henri Bendel, where I once helped a 13 year old with an Hermes bag.
@FVS_Metalhead @MannyOWar usually people who can shop at places like Barney's have no concern for other people. Entitlement is rich is NYC.
@noyokono I recommend the Abbaye.

@threetosleep @JonathanKDick @kyleantivenin @MannyOWar I'm allergic 
@threetosleep @JonathanKDick @kyleantivenin @MannyOWar this news has pretty much made my year. Thank you, thank you 
@threetosleep @JonathanKDick @kyleantivenin @MannyOWar @mmschocolate okay WHAT?! Seriously leaving work early just to find them.
@threetosleep @JonathanKDick @kyleantivenin @MannyOWar still wish they'd bring back coconut or crispy M&amp;Ms. @mmschocolate please.
@kyleantivenin it's a pretty rad job 
Please enjoy this video of a very sleepy Meat Tube puppy and have a wonderful Sunday  https://t.co/CvHohv7JOv
@threetosleep @JonathanKDick @kyleantivenin @MannyOWar holy shit are these really real?!
@kyleantivenin it's the other way around, I think. My goal in life is to have the heart of a dog 
@kyleantivenin chicken noodle, except I pick out the chicken bits and give them to my dog friends.

@OldThunderMetal my mom's the same. I haven't decorated my house for anything for a decade. Owl figurines + various animal skulls ovah heah.
@OldThunderMetal oof. I'm sorry.
@noyokono Liszt and going to the Catskills
Anyone #strandedinUS #strandedinnewyork I have a warm place to stay, food, and dogs to cuddle.

@erickjpressman @realDonaldTrump there is literally nothing \"interesting\" about a senseless and brutal slaying of dozens of people.
Major relief as a close family friend in Paris notified us she's okay. Heart is so heavy for those in terror.
There will be no Friday Night Poll. Y'all should be praying tonight for those affected by violence, regardless of your religious belief.
@iMiaSanMia @basementgalaxy @BernieMcCrib
@jaci_KVLT @UnScholars same
@UnScholars only a few short hours til Friday Night Poll!
@FVS_Metalhead I thank God every day that I inhabit the last remaining sliver of old Italy here  they're pretty excellent.
@FVS_Metalhead hmmm maybe it would be best to disguise it as a bag of seasoned kale chips??
@GrimKim bbq
@FVS_Metalhead I'll be working at the gym for Friday Night Poll! Feel free to deliver Arbys 
@Scrapyardzine congrats! And happy house hunting 
@MannyOWar considering I'd never had more than one month's rent at any given time, you're probably right.
@MannyOWar have faith, yo.
@MannyOWar (any leftover money would go to discovering a way to 3D print Quaaludes)

@KelseyChapstick @AltarOfTheCowl @sethw PERFECT OCCASION. KZ post BDAY EXTRAVAGANZA!!!
@AltarOfTheCowl @schulerbenson right in the chest.
@AltarOfTheCowl @schulerbenson no lie, a guy at a show this summer ripped his button down open and yelled, \"HIT ME PLEASE!!!\" so I obliged.
@schulerbenson you just gave me such a great idea. Brass knuckles 2015. Stick doused with hot oil and embedded with rusty nails 2016.
@schulerbenson I mean.... I like to do my part in objectifying and marginalizing men who come to my shows by spitting and hitting. Fuck it.
@sethw @jaci_KVLT you should! And make it daily!
@sethw thank you :')
@AltarOfTheCowl @sethw @MannyOWar @_jeremiahn it's really not bad in Brooklyn (at least my tiny neck of the woods) way less than the city.
@sethw @jaci_KVLT omfg tell me how please (real bad at computers)
@jaci_KVLT @sethw this is the greatest thing on Twitter tonight A+++
@sethw @AltarOfTheCowl @MannyOWar @_jeremiahn I can assure you that you can come literally any time and there will be at least one rad show.
@jaci_KVLT @VoidRitual I asked my gyn years ago if she'd spay me and she was repulsed. But like, come on.
@MannyOWar @AltarOfTheCowl @VoidRitual @erickjpressman but I like my current solo project :(
@AltarOfTheCowl @MannyOWar @_jeremiahn @sethw also you and ya wifey and Paul should totally visit. Theres an insane amount of vegan eateries
@AltarOfTheCowl @MannyOWar @_jeremiahn @sethw ooooh hear that, Manny? Favorite person.
@MannyOWar @_jeremiahn @sethw it's all good. Real friends don't hold grudges 
@MannyOWar @sethw @Captain_MW @jaci_KVLT @UnScholars @_jeremiahn yeah I know it's hard for you to grasp but some people like me 
@MannyOWar @erickjpressman @Captain_MW @sethw @jaci_KVLT @_jeremiahn I think everybody hates condoms
@MannyOWar @erickjpressman @Captain_MW @sethw @jaci_KVLT @_jeremiahn  this is without contest the worst article I ever read half of
@erickjpressman @MannyOWar @Captain_MW @sethw @jaci_KVLT @UnScholars @_jeremiahn  wouldn't want to give my selfie stick AIDS
@sethw @MannyOWar @Captain_MW @jaci_KVLT @UnScholars @_jeremiahn thank you for defending my (fatass) honor Seth

@TwilightFauna yeah well we're staying at your house so,
@sethw update: I'll be eating the whole bag. Probably the best cookies ever tasted. Think of a Nilla Wafer but chocolate with fudge inside.
@TwilightFauna watch it be like, when we tour and I won't even be here.
@TwilightFauna DON'T EVEN TEASE WHEN?!
@TwilightFauna please do this and please report back and depending on what happens I will DM you my address 
@TwilightFauna atta boy

@sethw @MannyOWar @jaci_KVLT @UnScholars @Captain_MW @_jeremiahn you are mailing me cookies right?
@_jeremiahn @MannyOWar never actually met IRL because he's too much of a wimp to come to a show
@MannyOWar @_jeremiahn @Captain_MW @jaci_KVLT @sethw I don't know when we became best enemies but I rather like it
@MannyOWar @Captain_MW @_jeremiahn @jaci_KVLT @sethw better than dressing like a guy that beats his wife and doesn't have electricity
@MannyOWar @Captain_MW @_jeremiahn @sethw @Scrapyardzine @mathrawk @ezsnappin YOU, smartass. I dress regular as shit.
@MannyOWar @Captain_MW @_jeremiahn @sethw @Scrapyardzine @MathRawk @EZSnappin okay seriously though why the fuck do you dress so dumb
@MathRawk start here https://t.co/yacifUqRPy
@MathRawk also 'Omega 6: Nem tudom a neved' turned 40 this year (favorite Hungarian rock band, they toured with Scorpions quite a bit)
@LCosgrove @Kza @alexengquist it was more like a dozen, throughout Canada and the US. Buncha prudes if you ask me.
@kyleantivenin no because it was likely when o was a baby. My dad was into some cool shit.
Nothin' lasts forever\nAnd we both know hearts can change\nAnd it's hard to hold a candle\nIn the warm November rain
Listening to Bethlehem for the first time at age 30 is akin to tasting red meat for the first time at 26. The door to the basement is open.
I never got hard into Bethlehem but my dear friend Theo has corrected my mistake and this shit will certainly get me through the NYC winter.
@dkaps89 nyugodjk bkben

@TwilightFauna @_JUCIFER_ buncha NY places do that + its changing shit real quick. Very awesome to witness but still baffled it took so long
@blackmetalbrews @jfrebe @AltarOfTheCowl this whole shit is mad depressing
@jfrebe lol I saw that band at Warped Tour with the awful girl I was friends with like, 15 years ago.
@megans_law @TripMetal because of this RT, I was able to remember going to the bar AFTER the show last night so thank you!
@stainedandlit also just realized I wasn't following you since I quit Twitter and came back (it fucked up my whole shit )
@stainedandlit sooo sick. Not as loud as I would have liked but that's also probably because I'm old &amp; deaf.
@blackmetalbrews @jfrebe @AltarOfTheCowl I'm feeling reeeeeeal old rn, great thing to wake up to

@skulltoaster @Haulix cause of death 
@sethw @Haulix hell yeah!
@MetalShayne2000 he once told me he liked Puddle of Mudd and Disturbd, so yeah, I like to think I am helping future him get laid more.
@missleylaha @UnScholars love so much from that era too but those bands were entirely underrated.
Really feel bad for my coworker who is just an innocent kid and the next four hours of his life will be spent listening to Unsane.
@UnScholars holy crap #same

@MannyOWar literally only interested in seeing Luminous Vault. Show'd out already this month 
@MannyOWar yeah I gathered that from the dozen posts you made about it today!
@MannyOWar yes, why?
@AltarOfTheCowl @SLAVES_BC @TwilightFauna *shudder*
@SLAVES_BC @AltarOfTheCowl @TwilightFauna 2x for me too! WHOA! Maybe we have been separated at birth.
@MannyOWar @saintvitusbar :'(
@MannyOWar @saintvitusbar I'm going but only to catch my friends band and I have no desire to meet you IRL 
@AltarOfTheCowl @SLAVES_BC @TwilightFauna we have a lot in common as we both wear all black and have both been hit by cars

@chris_redar hahahagah
@chris_redar oh, I posted it to another secret FB group. Add 4 add?
@chris_redar YES I LOVE HIS WORK! (No shit, have a bunch of it saved to my phone)
@ObsidianHyoid @missleylaha oh my god hahahahaha more of these please!
@chris_redar took one for the team and searched \"Minion porn\" and I'm here to inform you to NOT do that I repeat do NOT Google \"Minion porn\"
@chris_redar from what I could gather it was a Tomb Raider style game but with Minions. I don't know.

@erickjpressman @MathRawk I'd just like to invite @BernieMcCrib over to this
@MathRawk pretty much all I listened to from 2008-2011. I was in three bands at the time and kinda hated listening to music. LPC rules!!!
@MathRawk Orville Sash record is my absolute favorite though hands fucking down.
@jaci_KVLT @CelticFrosty @MannyOWar I had a real bad experience with dumplings once so that kind of ruined food for me. 
@MathRawk Puck Butler
@FVS_Metalhead yay!!! Good boy, JD 
@CelticFrosty @MannyOWar I never actually tried it. But I had Indian food three times and loved it!
@MannyOWar uhhh Jackson Diner is nowhere near me. Either Jackson Heights or like West Village ish. FOH.
@MannyOWar Thai is GROSS. Indian all the way. Does Jackson Diner deliver??
@MetalShayne2000 maybe on the back?
Last night I slept for more hours than all of last weekend combined. And I'm going to take a shower and go to the city. #what

@kenk666 definitely beautiful to recall the things I did yesterday and today 
@AltarOfTheCowl 
@AltarOfTheCowl it's weird how fucking exhausted I am. Kinda feel like an old hag but psyched about the opportunity to sleep more than 2 hrs
Second night of not being completely shitfaced in three weeks! Patting myself on the goddamn back and going to bed at a reasonable hour #yay

@SLAVES_BC @unknownrelic here is his prize https://t.co/MxM8kLpknB
@SLAVES_BC @unknownrelic here is his prize https://t.co/s0zVWeUqdC
@Petkau holllllaaaaaa 
@Lefebvre_Sam it's the best kind of lullaby.
@unknownrelic noted.
@unknownrelic I'd find you and physically harm you otherwise 
@MannyOWar @BernieMcCrib also I think he meant berating YOU. But we are all friends here so let's just be creative.
@MannyOWar @BernieMcCrib wait can I go by Mgn from now on?
ONE MORE THING: why has no one mentioned the best avenue of all to listen to music? L I V E. Go out and support IRL if you can. We love it.
@MetalShayne2000 HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
@AltarOfTheCowl @jshstew @metaltxt detailed depictions of disemboweled and dismembered women being raped by demons. But a cartoon phallus NO
@AltarOfTheCowl @jshstew @metaltxt you can't imagine the endless hours I have bitched and moaned about the same exact thing.
@MetalShayne2000 fairly certain that's why he became a heroin addict.
@AltarOfTheCowl @jshstew or use @metaltxt 's version.
@AltarOfTheCowl @jshstew please do this.
@unknownrelic only you, Stephen.
@jshstew @AltarOfTheCowl hahahaha even more missing ejaculate than the Best Buy version.
@AltarOfTheCowl I thought we were on there??? Or, that might be the one we said \"Fuck It\" to because they wanted an entirely different cover
@FVS_Metalhead and SoundCloud, small labels, record stores, SoulSeek, YouTube, etc
@CloudsCollide yeah it's going on my fridge. It will be used to display clippings of alternative porn.
@megans_law That being said, whatever avenue suits you for listening, my only hope is that it's one where the dick has not been edited out.
As a musician, I don't really care what format you listen to. I'm just psyched and honored to have an outlet and output that moves y'all.
Found this really great magnet in the ladies room. #? https://t.co/p6Pibsb3LM
Cannot for the life of me figure out which of the three sad Polish drunks played Soundgarden on the jukebox, but it rules nonetheless.
@axeslasher @metaltxt you very well may have and you wouldn't even know it
@AltarOfTheCowl I should review movies, really.
@AltarOfTheCowl Harry Potter had sports too and a really big dog.
@AltarOfTheCowl oh yes I think he passed away and they had to cast another one. Or is that Harry Potter?
@AltarOfTheCowl well there was that little anemic looking child guy who wanted the gold ring so he could be badass but that's all I got.
@AltarOfTheCowl I watched them in order a couple times, very stoned so I couldn't tell you shit about what happened.
@AltarOfTheCowl as I got this mention, this came on my TV (room mate just left this on and went out) https://t.co/ufUS5CXzlE
@metaltxt Rider fuckin' Strong? YOU ARE ENIGMA.TXT
@metaltxt wow how very .txt of you. Also, so Elijah fuckin' Wood knows who you are but NONE OF US.
@Petkau have ended up a junkie had he been chosen to live in that movie instead of Wood.
@Petkau I don't know why I lost all the people I was following when I came back, but I'm sorry about that. Also wonder if Culkin would (1/2)
@metaltxt whoa for real?
Two fates rest in your hands as each boy clutches onto you, dangling off a cliff over the sea. Who do you save?
@metaltxt oh it's the Daily News. 
@metaltxt and so handsome 
@BernieMcCrib @MannyOWar tmi you know I hate basketball
@BernieMcCrib @MannyOWar u wanna R or..?
@BernieMcCrib @MannyOWar fuck you Kvn Chvrches is not only boring but also cannot seem to spell like an adult person humans.
@KevinWunderlich I can assure you no one from your job is on Twitter
@KevinWunderlich can you please unprivate your acct so I can RT fucking everything
@Scrapyardzine @BoingBoing and I wonder how many languages the assailant can speak.
@metaltxt @jaci_KVLT @AltarOfTheCowl I expect you to get really drunk hell-oooo 
@MannyOWar @jaci_KVLT tattoo artiste
@MannyOWar @jaci_KVLT ooo I wonder who the hater is! Anyway I got that shit and maybe I'll see him next time he's here (monthly)
@jaci_KVLT @AltarOfTheCowl yeah the wedding is in three weeks and y'all are invited ;)
@AltarOfTheCowl @jaci_KVLT tattoo artist from VA, was here for the weekend as a guest at his friends' shops, Vae Solis is his fave Scorn rec
@AltarOfTheCowl @jaci_KVLT Y'ALL he just took his hat off and he is also bald and I think I'm in love.
@jaci_KVLT don't be playin' girl 
@jaci_KVLT his transaction is taking forever because he also had stacks of cash. Weed guy or tattoo artist?
Weird to ask a guy in the line at the bank for his # because he's got a SCORN back patch?
@CloudsCollide @AltarOfTheCowl p sure they saw our cover and felt objectified. It's funny though bc Epistasis is up and they're 1/2 of CS.
@AltarOfTheCowl hahahahahaha
@AltarOfTheCowl the record release show was the following day. Very emotional time as I'd thought I'd never see them in real life.
@AltarOfTheCowl our record didnt exist in physical form til 1/22/15
@CloudsCollide @AltarOfTheCowl haha you got that snide email too that just said \"Application Rejected. Reason: band is NOT metal\"??
@AltarOfTheCowl oh, wait, I forgot Metal Archives said we aren't metal 
@AltarOfTheCowl hey so... teeeechnically.... MLaaW came out this year thanks to the delay with the jackets, soooo...... 
@chris_redar somewhere on Monday Twitter exists five massively idiotic shit trucks who all retweeted @KuKluxElsa. Gonna be a great week!
@chris_redar I immediately felt bad after I did it, it won't happen again.
@TightToTheNail it just occurred to me that a Twitter account that solely tweets about Tool lyrics and melodies would be amazing.
@TightToTheNail MJK will do that to you. Also Danny Carrey is the greatest drummer alive today.
@chris_redar @MattWalshBlog REAL Garbageberry
. @chris_redar @MattWalshBlog the thing about soc media is that you can tailor what you see on FB whereas Twitter is a murky cesspool.
@TightToTheNail YEAH!!!
@TwilightFauna @sethw DM me y'all emails
@sethw maybe I'll do one JUST FOR YOU
@sethw specifically if I included convos/pics. We are a raunchy bunch 
@sethw I feel like if I did that you wouldn't want to be my friend anymore 
Pssst.... You can catch them open for us 12/12 at @saintvitusbar  https://t.co/PyExiGEPuz
@MannyOWar @schulerbenson wasn't really my vibe. I don't like touching other people so Kvn and I just drank and smoked right after.
@schulerbenson @MannyOWar oral fixation Crocs
@MetalShayne2000 @MannyOWar I should get on that but will likely forget
@MetalShayne2000 @MannyOWar yaaaas and let's all go see him except Manny.
@MannyOWar there was a guy vaping at AA last night and I wanted to tell him he should just have a drink :/
@MetalShayne2000 @MannyOWar y'all ever check that Dead Low Tide demo? I'd kill to still have it, so much more grit than the record.
@MannyOWar @markangelbrandt fuck I hate chvrches
@MannyOWar @markangelbrandt kvrses
@MannyOWar @BernieMcCrib nah he's chill. Bassist in CS.
@MannyOWar @BernieMcCrib was there
@SomePersonsTwit @HelloPoodle @MrsJellySantos your handle literally is SomePersonsTwit. You don't have any authority to demand evidence.
@chris_redar just the words \"I demand\" from some loser-ass nobody like theyre the District Fucking Attorney in the case like please fuck off
@chris_redar @ashrouen exhibit A: https://t.co/le2FCm3PhQ
@SomePersonsTwit @MrsJellySantos @HelloPoodle you can jump to conclusions. Not sure where you would get that I hate you but okay.
@chris_redar @ashrouen update: nurse had to delete her acct bc ppl demanding \"further evidence\" ie video or obituary or name of the baby FOH
@MrsJellySantos @SomePersonsTwit @HelloPoodle you need evidence of the mountain of racist bullshit this entire country was built on? FOH
@TwilightFauna insanely jealous
@kenk666 hahaha don't apologize! Not stalkerish, this is a public forum after all ;)
@TwilightFauna ugh I wish I had thought of that
@kenk666 dogs, gym, and more dogs. The deli referenced here is next to dog job #1. The bar commonly referenced is because I drink too much:/
@chris_redar boy why you think I carry that giant purse?!
@chris_redar or every girlfriend of an abusive athlete
@kenk666 three
@megans_law Today is already a very fucking weird day and only an hour into my shift.
@megans_law he's not even buying anything. Just explaining the situation to the cashier (who he doesn't know on a personal level)
@megans_law he's not even buying anything. Just explaining the situation to the cashier (who he doesn't know on a personal level)
Guy in the deli announcing he is going to kill his landlord because his girlfriend had a miscarriage because the landlord stressed them out.
@chris_redar or literally every mass shooting from the past several years
@chris_redar this made me wonder what the manner and cause of death would be listed as. \"Pneumonia by manner of racism\" or something.
@chris_redar people teaching their own children (or students) to hate or humiliate is really a form of abuse if you think about it.
This was the only thing that came up in my FB 'memories' thing and it's still relevant and still sad as hell: https://t.co/EYNcZZOIlb
@chris_redar @ashrouen and that's a garbage thought to think this early on a Monday.
@chris_redar @ashrouen my thought immediately after the initial upset was, \"at least that's one less racist asshole making it to adulthood.\"
@axeslasher YEAH!!!
@jonbeilin no, but I will investigate further! Thank you!
In the end, we love our desire.\nNot what is desired.
@e_coolfuzz the most beautiful play of the season!
@laurconnors SAME
@dkaps89 that was GLORIOUS
YEAH!!!!!!!  #FlyEaglesFly
THAT FROG HOP WAS SO SICK!!!
More flags than Benjamin Franklin Parkway
Apology in advance for sports tweets. \n\nCOME ON BIRDS.
@Petkau @SLAVES_BC GUYS. ASAP. SERIOUSLY.
@SLAVES_BC @Petkau hold off on the Slit 7\" and watch that IMMEDIATELY.
@Petkau @SLAVES_BC now I want to watch The Jinx again!
@Petkau @SLAVES_BC rad jinx on the word 'hatred' A+
@SLAVES_BC @Petkau jeez, finally. I thought your silence was indicative of your hatred 
@kenk666 no, but both my pentagram tattoo and 666 tattoo were burning and itchy for that hour.
@Petkau @AltarOfTheCowl thank you!
@AltarOfTheCowl okay this is the episode I will start with what is it?
Watching the Ben Carson movie and not gonna lie, kinda wanna vote for his ass now.
@EZSnappin I didn't read the question and just chose black metal as I enjoy it more than death metal.
@BruceFraser @metaltxt @sethw YO I saw a bear crossing the road in the mountains one day and lost it. How many have you fought?!?!
@sethw @BruceFraser @metaltxt that was interesting. I held hands with a total stranger (and also my best friend). Gonna try again in a week.
@BruceFraser @metaltxt first AA meeting. They have Oreos!
About to enter a church for the first time in approximately seven years.
As promised, a photo of Lou Reed and Sweet Jane (and the ass end of Tina - short for Christina Aguilera) @EZSnappin https://t.co/kXgzNiplfy
@EZSnappin I'll try to get a photo of Sweet Jane and Lou Reed together (also fuck that record)
@EZSnappin and OMFG a dog named Lou Reed is coming to stay overnight later what is happening https://t.co/ajFIFjSLxK
@EZSnappin coincidentally, I am watching a terrier named Sweet Jane today and her owner is actually loaded (Broadway actress)
@metal_of_death I began following you at the perfect time thank you
@MetalShayne2000 this tweet provides excellent insight on what it's like to live inside a female anatomical structure A+++
.@twitter really with #redcups?
@kyleantivenin @AltarOfTheCowl oh hey this is a thing now #RedCups
@kyleantivenin @AltarOfTheCowl you could pretty much say \"Xians mad\" on any given day and it would be accurate.
@AltarOfTheCowl seeeeeriously. Major bummer.
@noyokono writing is writing, whether it's notes or notes.
@noyokono yooooooooo
@noyokono actually no cuz then I'd be a young widow
@noyokono would
Thanks for an excellent time and safe travels, here is a bonus pic for you @ffwolfcone @olsonpower @c_razy_jim https://t.co/gX6SrprICk
@chris_redar @kyleantivenin @jfrebe @AltarOfTheCowl Galaxy 6 but I almost went for that one, am now annoyed I didn't. #wantthebeejemoji
@chris_redar @kyleantivenin @jfrebe @AltarOfTheCowl whoa how do I get those?!
@chris_redar @schulerbenson STATE god
@chris_redar @schulerbenson would like to visualize her in a post mortem statement
@VoidRitual and they didn't want to be identified (much like the KKK wear masks) because they understand on some level that they are wrong.
@VoidRitual two things that struck me: the kids parents are a gay couple so by default the workers should have quit based on \"religion\", no?
@VoidRitual had to look that up and immediately regretted doing so.
@schulerbenson @chris_redar I carry with my a tiny satchel containing screws because some people deserve flat tires.
@schulerbenson @chris_redar literally pig parking https://t.co/H9JNkpz5DR
@schulerbenson @chris_redar of course it was what a whore you should kill her then say \"nice ass\" or \"smile bitch\"
@chris_redar https://t.co/H9JNkpz5DR
@chris_redar @kyleantivenin @jfrebe @AltarOfTheCowl half of em have their eyes closed, android user heah https://t.co/Po53ppQIJl
@chris_redar @kyleantivenin @jfrebe @AltarOfTheCowl unsure of which of the six blowjob faces is THE blowjob face, but my guess is the end ??
Slept in a bed full of CRUMBS because I gave Sgt a pig ear while I was out and he's messy af  https://t.co/YeiPZ3l4YY
@chris_redar @kyleantivenin @jfrebe @AltarOfTheCowl it makes PERFECT SENSE Cran.
@chris_redar @kyleantivenin @jfrebe @AltarOfTheCowl studying this emoji pattern more deeply today and realizing it sums up my existence. A+
Man. Tragic news to wake up to. Proud to say I shook the man's hand. Fantastic human. https://t.co/jn4bsHq4KI
@kenk666 yessir! They're headed back there today.

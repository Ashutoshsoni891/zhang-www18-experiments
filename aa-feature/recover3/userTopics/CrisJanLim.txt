@MissSpookiness9 it's an amazing prime lens. Most of the footage from the mouthlike trailer was shot with it :) best thing its pretty cheap
1 of my fav lens right now is the cheap 40mm 2.8 pancake. I just love that focal length. My next lens will be a 50mm 1.2. Saving up. #canon

@MissSpookiness9 u need to concur that one day !
@freestylebunny lol overnight or what ?
@jamie2109  I wouldn't say enjoyed it just yet. It was new and strange. I just didn't hate it that's all .
@freestylebunny oh I'm probably at 80-85 % lol . I don't smoke . I reached my goal weight and now I currently don't drink . Ha .
@Jana_Pe  I wouldn't have it any other way .
@freestylebunny thanks . Will power up 25% . Lmfao !
@lindafromoz lol
@MissSpookiness9 that's what I'm aiming for ! I need to balance the idea of I can have fun either way.
@freestylebunny water all night oh and a 5 hour energy cuz I started getting tired lol
@MiglenaMerdz yeah . It was entertaining for sure.
@MissSpookiness9 yes, especially for me. I need to get used to it cuz i hate having the fact that I need to be drunk to have a good time
@MiglenaMerdz oh I saw many entertaining moments of drunk people. I even asked my friend. \" wow do I look like that when I'm wasted?\" Lol
@Jana_Pe ur right . It's a first in my life and I'm in my 30s. Lol . I love a challenge. Just found a new one . ha
@lindafromoz yeah so now I have a new goal. To be comfortable at a bar cuz that right now is hard and awkward. Lol
@PaingelxTWx so true . A tip for you or anyone who wants to know. It's not the juicing u need to focus on. It's your \"will power\" !
@Lady_XXX_ thank you 
@lindafromoz thanks Linda . I might have looked awkward sober while everyone was drunk but at least I proved it to myself !
@PaingelxTWx thank u . It was kinda hard but I passed the ultimate test to myself.
Just got home from 2 nightclubs n I'm 100% sober. A first, in my entire life. It felt kinda Twilight zone-ish but I didn't hate it. Lol

Last day of my nutribullet 10 day smoothie/juice cleanse ! I can see and feel the difference. Detoxed all the crap out &amp; I feel amazing.
@6229Glambert i would get checked out to see if your healthy enough to go that long. the 10 day worked for me.

@feralunaris thank u
@jamie2109 thanks !
@GlitterAngel81 you'll notice a difference in 10 lbs .
@Emkelicious I'm have a nutribullet so it  isn't 100% juicing. But I am just blending fruits &amp; veggies. All I drink for 5 days. 3 days left
@VampsThrall thank you
@kaiaonai just workout 3-5 days a week . My last 10 lbs is a juice cleanse. Be fit and eat healthy and you'll loose the weight .
@GNastenka thank u
@GlitterAngel81 just don't give up ! Keep on going and you'll get there. Psychically and mentally !
@Emkelicious everyday was hard ! It was a struggle but once ur there You'll never look back and will be stronger mentally n physically !

I feel like this album gave me a stroke, but in a way where I feel absolutely nothing but perplexed thoughts.
Dude honestly if you asked me if I liked it, I couldn't give you a solid answer. Ask if I hate it? Same thing. Ask if "okay?" Same thing.
I honestly don't understand how D.R.A.M. made this new album of his.

@wiseaufilmsusa Yes. I've dealt with it for four years at golf parties here

I def will say that the rise of post-dubstep did pave way for other forms of bass music to usurp its relevancy in the mainstream sphere.
I think every music scene is important in terms of its longevity amongst the public, but dubstep had a rise like a premature ejaculation.
@netsirkcomolli YASSSS go queen
Meanwhile Burial and Kode9 will always be dubstep's most acclaimed heroes.
"DUBSTEP'S GONNA BE THE NEXT BIG THING!!" - 2010Now what
I think it's funny how Excision, Datsik, and all these other dubstep artists have just now fallen into "niche" status instead of "relevant."

I just know that I'm probs gonna bawl like a bitch when she drops me off tomorrow  At least I can cry knowing that we still love each other
I just wanted to share with y'all how important it is to keep your loved ones close, no matter if they are friends, lovers, or family.
I've learned so much about my life at a weirdly ripe age of 22, that essentially, I am now growing to be a better version of myself.
Even if I'm being overly dramatic right now, don't ever question my sincerity, for these three months have been the best months of my life.
Point is y'all, if you and your loved one are going to separate, think back and be grateful for all the great times you shared together.
All the dates I've had with her, all the times we cried together, all the times we showed how much we loved each other; I regret nothing.
When I look at these photos that I have shared with her, I'm not sad. I am happy, just like how we felt when we too https://t.co/EfHcKTaaYk
I am proud that I proved myself to not be a piece of shit, and that I will continue to be there for her, even when on a break.
I am proud to have been part of her life, and that I was able to provide enough love for her to know that I will always be there for her.
My girlfriend and I are currently taking a break, and so, we spent our final night together like Gods.Best selfie https://t.co/l9IY6Te5Z3
@karenrullman I love you
I love my friends and I love my family.
But sometimes, you need that encouragement and support from people who love you to realize your worth.
Thankfully my therapy sessions have allowed me to have an extra hand help out with other ways to combat my struggles, and it feels good.
Do not ignore the emotions of one who is depressed. Sometimes, we need that extra bit of love, no matter how down we may appear.

Armed clowns, clowns staring at children, and clowns that have tried to lure children into the woods.
It's hard to tell if it's advertising for a horror movie, or if it's some weird epidemic that social media has been encouraging. It's fucked
These creepy clowns are making their way to Long Island. If some of y'all spot these fuckers, DO NOT INTERACT WITH THEM.

I just had the most intense political conversation with my suitemate. Never felt this prideful when discussing what makes me this passionate
My Pol Pot shirt has been calling my name since watching this debate.
This proves that anyone can be president. Even Plank from Ed Edd n Eddy could be president at this point.
Trump even had the RNC hating the fuck out of him, and he managed to secure the nomination regardless of who stood in his way.
Clinton doesn't win, because she already had a jump start at being corrupt with the DNC helping her out. Trump proved the impossible.
As I've mentioned in a previous tweet from probably months ago, if you're still baffled at how he made it this far, read Roland Barthes.
Even if his Machiavellianism was poorly constructed and fucking clumsy, doesn't matter. Once a rhetoric was established, that was it.
From an amoral perspective, Trump turned emotions into the real voice of his fanbase, not facts, and he knew how to manipulate them all.
When you successfully drive passion and fear into the hearts and minds of those who don't want a continuation of the past 8 years, it's done
At the end of the day, the real winner of this election is Trump. Even if Clinton wins, Trump proved that America is more broken than ever.
DONALD TRUMP IS THE KING OF DEATHWELL WAIT WTF DOES THAT MAKE ME?
This debate is basically politic's Wylin Out.

@jessicadegg
That feeling when you don't understand the reading for tomorrow, like at all.
I just quickly backspaced on an impulsive decision to listen to Post Malone. I'm so glad I caught myself in the process.
Some ho ass shit, makin my ass clap.
I actually made Eau like a year ago, but I never gave it the full acceptance until now. Had a lot of fun making that track but it was a ho.

I'm starting to get sick of one of my suitemates holy shit
Chipotle margaritas are god tier
"Divorced Dad's upcoming EP 'Loudmouth' is coming out soon are you gonna cop it?" https://t.co/EizmWz4rk2
First day of therapy was actually pretty good. Definitely going back. I learned a lot, even though the initial session was only a half hour
Feeling great one day at a time
Tomorrow I get to go to therapy after 9 years of not bothering. Whatever lol all I know is that I need to focus on myself and no one else
I'm gonna take a break on social media for awhile.I love you all
https://t.co/YxooY77apE:)
Just had the realest talk with my suitemates. I have now entirely fleshed out my feelings.
ThisI love you https://t.co/FxWBD624CF
Feeling good, yet a lot to express.
Lol I thought it was free and open to everyone at any time but they clarified it was by appointment, but all is well. Misleading info tho
Can't hurt to try
Just set up my first appointment with a therapist. Giving it a try after years of not bothering.
@karenrullman I miss you too
https://t.co/labJaMEYBTThis is purely retarded but I can't deny my love for this.The playboy is back in the groove.
This is gonna be a fucking fun senior year.
I feel so alive
About to cover Bryson Tiller and I'm so pumped because my voice is so fucking BOSS tonight.
How can I make a fucking 4 star chicken / pasta meal but then butcher scrambled eggs? Dead.
Gonna learn how to make scrambled eggs, cause most of my breakfast game is so weak, yet I know how to make a fucking boss dinner LOL.
My entire heart is made of rose gold
I am awful at paying attention
About to make some ratchet music and I'm hella excited.
I was standing next to friends fighting earlier over how one didn't invite them to a Beyonc concert with her. Trust issues galore LOL
When you see a pic of yourself circa 2011 and wonder why it was shot: https://t.co/6l04UKdvsj

Another Divorced Dad project in the works.This is gonna be hella fun.

Life is great. We can't expect ourselves to be happy 24/7, but we can always prove to others how amazing we can be to each other.
I read "real friends" in a Kanye voice and I'm pretty proud
Don't be afraid to share your feelings. Real friends really care about you, and if they fuck up, they will make things right again.
Also, one more thing, trust can be rebuilt. If the person who fucked up is willing 2 make things right, that's real dedication.
This is just a general stream of consciousness from the dad. Much love. Signing off.
But never let anyone destroy you.
If we are to err, then that's nature. I can be upset over something serious, but at the end of the day, that's life. It always is rocky.
But always be willing to give people chances, because the only thing people should expect, is that no human is perfect (except Lil B)
If it's getting to the point where the other person did something SOO IRREVERSIBLY FUCKED UP that the connection breaks forever, so be it.
Sometimes, selfishness can get the best of us. I get it, because it's happened to me countless times.
If you ever go through a period where someone has done something fucked up, always remember that it's wise to understand the other's POV.
It's unnecessary and quite immature
Hating someone is so stupid, because all what it does is create tension between two/multiple parties looking to see who's hot shit.
To forgive is divine is such a corny ass expression tbh, but in real life, there's no need to harbor hate. Sometimes, people deserve chances
Mistakes, no matter how severe or minor, are made constantly, but I know that people have more good in them than the bad.
All smiles from here :)

The Neodadaism era will always grow.
I still think Lil B should perform at the Grammys. Even after all these years, he's deserved that spotlight more than any other rapper.
@xaladbar Yum
Fuck the Grammys anyway. I just think a dude like Chance, who's been hardworking and adventurous from day 1, deserves that opportunity.
Despite Chance being hit or miss for me, he deserves any Grammy nom, now that they allow streaming as acceptable forms of commodified music.
Chance's "Blessings" (the second one) is one of the most beautiful closers I've heard in all of music. Def in my top 10 tracks of the year.
My real night https://t.co/CFglgRkuJK

Me at the Purchase fuccboi narcissists https://t.co/ej0R7pDKoY
I think narcissism can be used wonderfully to inspire people. Mostly there are those who are too self absorbed to give a shit. Fuck them.
Like wouldn't it be best to have A LOT of friends as a healthy narcissist, rather than be shunned by lots who thing you're a selfish cock?
God complexes are so easy, &amp; it's so easy when you have a microcelebrity status, but please, wouldn't it be wise to not be a piece of shit?
Never trust a narcissist who constantly wants to belittle those "lesser than him/her."
There's a difference between using your narcissism to make you look healthy and respectable amongst others, and then those who are insane.
I'm a narcissist. Stands out in my clothes, my personality, everything. Am I cocky / pretentious? Yes, but I don't make people feel ashamed.
Brief rant time: narcissism
So grateful for jalapeo cheese sticks like this is so fucking good
I should do livestreams of me pregamming because I did one last year and it was fucking hilarious.

Come back to me when you listen to fucking Lil Yachty, Grateful Dead, Merzbow, and Mongolian Throat singing to show that you love everything

Shouts out the kids in K2 and K3 that suffered the fire outbreak. Shit went up in flames quicker than oil on a hibachi plate.
"Finally, something did happen, even though it still sucks that it happened anyway."
Like you can't guess things to just be 100% clear, so coming into this whole fire situation last night was actually insane.
Last year's shooting scare was pretty wild. It was definitely blown out of proportion and my friend and I knew it was, but it still was wild
Always something newsworthy every year at this school, whether a rapist, hate crime, potential shootings, and now a fire and a stalker.
I just heard that an old creep / potential rapist went around the freshmen girls' doors last night. Unreal. Our school gets no break.
Like it's actually crazy that this fire really erupted amongst a majority of these dorms

Now I gotta hear Blank Banshee's new album and my life is complete for 2016.
22, A Million might be the greatest album of the 21st century so far.
@loveraechh I wish I could retweet this
I'll shut up now cause I got class soon but please, listen to this album.
Dude like I can't even breathe and my heart is pounding.
Unbelievable
I can't believe this album exists.
Man, shit's getting me TOO emotional on the second run-through and I have class in a half hour LMFAO
@mattsoldano531 Along with the fact that he's released "Boys Don't Cry" as the multimedia final product, bringing together so many musicians
@mattsoldano531 Blonde is amazing. Obviously it isn't for everyone because it's very out there, but it shows how adventurous he is.
@mattsoldano531 It leaked!!!! Not the best of quality but it's the genuine product.
I can't even fathom how this shit was put together. This is some genius shit that I can't even comprehend.
I started crying during the intro and there were so many tears ran down through "Strafford" that just caught me by surprise.
But Vernon really has brought forth his most powerful work as both a producer and a songwriter. Holy..... fuck.
Bon Iver's self titled is a beautiful trip, and it's def my favorite album of 2011. Not trying to call myself a fanboy of Vernon (cont.)
Bon Iver probably released the most unbelievable album I've heard in a long while.22, A Million is officially my #1 album this year. Wow..
Every time I play this beat over I'm like shaking in excitement and fear
It's called "Milk"
Omg I'm making this new song that sounds like the most twisted shit I've done. Music video also probably? Gotta have @Ronin_SS promote it.
I'm gonna lose so much weight I'm going to look like a malnourished child from 1920s Russia

Larry King has fucked and married so many women he'll get over this dilemma so quick.

Also it just makes you look like a fucking scumbag.
You'd be flirting with disaster when you cheat on someone bc now YOU are responsible for anything that will make you regret your decision.
If you committed, you stay committed. Otherwise, break up / have a divorce. Idk why people find it that hard.
Honestly if you're not in love with the person you used to love anymore, cheating is only gonna make shit worse.
Okay on the real though, this just came to mind: lmfao out of nowhere I just heard that Larry King's wife cheated on him.
I was shaking the entire time. My previous tweets from yesterday are still coming true.
OH FUCK ME I JUST SPOILED ANOTHER NEW BON IVER TRACK THAT WAS PLAYED LIVE AT EAUX CLAIRES HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

I will honestly say, however, that Kanye knows where the talents lie in the industry, even if they are musically more talented than he is.
It's so obvious at this point that I am anticipating greatness. I somehow wish I hadn't heard of Bon Iver from Kanye, but I'm still thankful
First time I fucking heard Deathbreast, I was in a Halifax hotel. I was trying so hard not to scream. Could Bon Iver make a flawless gem?
Frank Ocean's Blonde will probably grow to be a classic too. Holy shit I'm like on the verge of tears from amazing music this year (&amp; last)
I've been freaking out over these new singles. Never have I ever been anticipating possibly a modern classic of our era.
I'm preparing for Bon Iver's new album like I'm going to die the next day.
@kristina_deg maybe they aren't pop punk LOL MAYBE THEY'RE SPECIAL!!!!

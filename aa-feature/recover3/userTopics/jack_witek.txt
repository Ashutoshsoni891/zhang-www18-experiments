Well done to everyone who made #NovaraIRL such a success. @AaronBastani, I left you a msg re cycling gloves and TBC.
and a very specific set of circumstances had to align to give Trump the win, to carry him over the line, but then what if Bernie had run?
anymore 'that's too wild to entertain' or 'nothing that crazy will fly w/ voters'? I'm sure we'll still be sanctioned for having ambition  &gt;
This cuts both ways: warnings of fascism is no longer just the left being a Cassandra, it's now a reality. Equally can it really be said &gt;
Not an accelerationist but if there could be any silver lining from Trump perhaps it's that we can now actually posit the impossible. &gt;

that musically, visually, in editing, in effects, yes is hugely derivative but is so much more than the sum of its parts, each of which &gt;

I think Star Wars is a bit like the American Dream/project. Yes it's all bound up in capitalism and slavery and yet, and yet it holds sway &gt;
The lumbering Imperial AT-ATs on Hoth being tied up by wire with Luke scurrying underneath somewhat a metaphor for Vietnam war. Anyway &gt;
is about facing impossible odds of Imperial military industrial complex, and Lucas imagined Empire as analogous to western imperialism. &gt;

Re refugee humanitarian crisis, 'Brexit had everything to do with Syria.' - Evelyn Farkas.
@Steve_Cooke I should say that regardless of twitter sparring if you want to talk further about any of this over the phone I'm game.
@Steve_Cooke honest mistake because of pooling of personal contacts with open letter ones. Enjoy trolling, I have other things in my life.
@Steve_Cooke Did you not just accuse me of being complicit in accessing @PeoplesMomentum database? No one has done that.
@Steve_Cooke Activists sharing contacts who obviously made a minor mistake with 2 key contacts. You are making very grandiose accusations.
@Steve_Cooke well I was told it was his so obviously there's confusion but we had really good convo. Stop spreading conspiracy theory.
@Steve_Cooke A lady picked up the phone of the other key contact. I had his umber because he signed our open letter. Stop exaggerating!
God damn... Rogue One is such a quotable film.
Leader of the free world is slang for a fart. Just let that sit with you for a minute, like flatulence on the London tube.
@Steve_Cooke Cool. I'm a mod. Your points re delegates need answers deeper than I'm giving, but big philosophical differences entailed.
@Steve_Cooke have you had a look at Opening Momentum on Facebook btw? Lots of articles and discussions on there regarding all this.
@Steve_Cooke and you know it's not as easy as that in reality. Also hugely time wasting.
@Steve_Cooke But that's a structure we don't want. We don't want 'special members' or delegates running around like Labour councillors.
@Steve_Cooke Then get on MxV and comment on proposal how we could incorporate that into our vision. We're not "Lansman's minions" right?
@Steve_Cooke What a bizarre argument, linking existing structure we want to democratise to future vision of new structure.
@Steve_Cooke Momentum is all about 'beginners' mate. And full time delegates aren't unpaid bureaucrats with little oversight?
@Steve_Cooke The staff would simply be there to facilitate in our vision. Also there'd still be staff even with delegates presumably.
@Steve_Cooke or at least we rotate them regularly with elections and have recall and limited terms and sortation.
@Steve_Cooke mate we're not talking terminology, u just fabricated a structure of our proposal. And there's no full timers on our Steering.
@Steve_Cooke If only life were so simple.
@Steve_Cooke maybe I'm misremembering the proposal but the word chair never appears in it anyway.
@Steve_Cooke In reality that's not what actually happens. My group's delegate is AWOL most of the time. They make themselves important.
@Steve_Cooke Because... because that's what you assert? There's nothing in proposal that says that.
@Steve_Cooke But we don't envisage the Steering Committee doing much beyond facilitating. With delegates, that's layers of hierarchy.
@Steve_Cooke What are you referring to re branches and emails? Our proposal is flat and non-hierarchical I think: https://t.co/aimrWWFk66
@Steve_Cooke For reference we're talking about this: https://t.co/aimrWWFk66

I mean I'm not puritanical in my dislike of delegates in Momentum, it's just you either have a loose org or you have a shadow Lab structure
How is that any different than the Fabian/Third Way approach of trying to be all things to all people &amp; keeping the core power structure?
This thing atm of trying to marry delegate and OMOV saying it's false division, we're under false consciousness. That's really unhelpful.

standards of ourselves and not attack those as attacking 'the movement' when they ask as much. The stakes are so high. We must not repeat &gt;
But there are currents of attitude, on the left I guess? Maybe it's just human nature. I hope it's not endemic. But we must hold higher &gt;

Peter Robbins "separating" from his co-author Larry Warren. UFO-logy is such a soap opera. So many cranky egos and histrionics.

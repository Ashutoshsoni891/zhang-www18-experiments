Me neither. It sucks.
Does anyone find it attractive that I use an inhaler? No? Thought so.

Why is today blowing so hard
A wolf doesn't loose sleep over the opinions of a sheep.
A sip and a puff is much needed at the moment
sorry i couldn't make it i was busy not being invited
Fat middle aged white men in Do Rags. Gotta love it
Skyrim is ruining my life.
Again. Everyone needs to stop with this 'illuminati' bullshit. You have no idea what you're talking about and it doesn't make you sound cool
@GraceToftemarkk they both sort of suck
It is what it is.
The first girl attacked in the movie \"Jaws\" was screaming in real pain - The harness broke her hip as it dragged her through the water.
Just Agnes and I, hanging out http://t.co/0L1SfvBNsS
I JUST WANT TO BE A VOICE ACTOR SO FUCKING BAD
I'm as bored as a slut on her period.
I just wanna go shoot sum hoops at the park
Its amazing how much emotion\na little mental concept like my can generate.\n- Eckhart Tolle
@MollyValentinee I try to visit at least once a week.\nDon't worry, I'd rather spork my eyes out
@MollyValentinee no, my mother dear lives there
Im steaming, boy.  ACTUALLY
Also, Camas, Washington can suck my dick. I promise to make it a horrid experience, prolly knock out what remaining teeth it has left.
I FUCKING HATE CAMAS WASHINGTON!\n\nPortland, my home, how I miss you, and a few of your occupants.
Oh Mother, every visit is bittersweet and eventful.  Oh Camas, how I hate that my mother lives in you.
Dark at 8:00pm? I don't miss this.
Getting so tired of people tagging my block.
@NGX11 that was so funny
The benevolent and wise are being thwarted, ostracized, what a bummer
I AM THE MAN WHO KNOCKS
\"Im like a black Michael Jackson\"
@andydick
I think in decimals and dollars\nI am the cause to all your problems
I think it's about time I shave the \"Macklemore\" off my head
You pick the time of death, miss\nI'll pick the cause
To those of you that didn't believe my last name is actually LOVE http://t.co/Kl64uD6fMU
@MollyValentinee get back to work, silly
Hi. Let's talk.
You're the echoes of my everything,\nYou're the emptiness the whole world sings at night.
Hey moon, please to forget to fall down..
@justinbieber you're a bitch.
@xxryaxx where? I looked, but I'm bad at troubleshooting. The sooner the better, honestly. Point me in the right direction
@Doll_ofthe_Dead sorry about the late response. I'm well, how are you?
Don't mess with the bull young man, you'll get the horns
No.
Because I have awesome friends. @ Lan Su Chinese Garden International HQ http://t.co/D6rnNeGdRJ
DO AS YOU PLEASE SHAME WILL FALLOW
Come along with me\nTo a place beside the sea\nWe can wander through the forrest \nAnd do so as we please
I'm an adult that keeps American Dad and Adventure Time on repeat in my room.
@MollyValentinee HAHAHAHAHA YES
I really hate that AA meetings only happen Monday nights.
Most shitty hipster trend ever? Glasses without frames.
My dick plays on the double feature screen\nYour dick went straight to DVD
Its enough to make an old man,\nScratch his head and think.
\"If all the world were apple pie\nAnd all the sea were ink\nAnd all trees were bread and cheese\nWhat would we have to drink?\"

After taking only a month of communication and crisis, talking to people made me realize how shitty listeners they really are  #eyeopener

@CuteKidVines @King_Alex5 seriously just watched this like 20 times and it's still funny 
Why is it we bullshit all day and when it comes time to go to bed we have the most important conversations! 
When Emily and I were butt ass naked and running up piles of dirt &gt;&gt;&gt;  #goodtimes #toofunny #michealphelps

@FontanezNick  you just have to be assertive 
@FontanezNick it's not bad it's a lot like 101 but you have a presentation and you gotta talk loud.. So that might be a problem for you

Not physically ready for this 4 hour lab
I'm so lucky to have a friend like @Sara_Allison24  she got up and went out of her way just to give me a stress ball #truefriend 
You know it's going to be a bad day when you punch your Caprisun straw all the way through #fmondays
When Sara used to hiss at people she didn't like

An #Aquarius tries to make their first introductions quite impacting and they get hurt if u don't remember them. @AlexisDonohoe #highscool
I'm honestly as bad as a little kid when it comes to going to the zoo
@Factsionary: August has the most birthdays, February has the least and most of the serial killers are born in November. @calabria_emily 
Zoo bound  
Why do I always feel the need to push everyone that's interested in me away? #deepthoughts #futurebetold I just want to kno everything is ok
@allisondonohoe I've been outta school to long I need to go back lol
Glad my schedule got fucked up all because of that one class cancellation

When a short person tries to hit &amp; misses, the coach laughs. But when a tall person passes &amp; it sucks the coach screams. @AlexisDonohoe

@broadwaycalls @erickjpressman hell yeah dood! we'll have some SF summer fun! (bring a parka)
@erickjpressman love is dead slaps the hardest
@erickjpressman I literally DID cry the first time I saw them in LA. it was hella emotional to hear/see those songs that mean so much to me.
@erickjpressman screeching weasel is so god damn good live too. this is gonna kick BUTT
that was bold. it's VERY funny, but the funniest thing I've ever seen is and will always be Farley falling down the mountain in black sheep.
watching that chase scene with Kramer and the Plaza Cable guy and its the funniest thing I've ever seen
@erickjpressman hella pop
why does gaslight anthem play shows with big ass jackets on? are they cold? also why do people listen to them? #questions

the fact that you don't appreciate me is only going to hurt you in the long run.
how come i lose 5 followers for simply pointing out how stupid and ignorant you all are??
pretty soon an \"LP\" is just gonna be an email
it's something else too right? is it seriously just an iTunes playlist?? everyone younger than me is insufferable.
maybe this will be the year that someone explains to me what a \"mixtape\" is. other than an iTunes playlist that people call a mixtape.

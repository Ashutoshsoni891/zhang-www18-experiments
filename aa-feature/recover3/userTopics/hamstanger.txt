Suggestion: Smash ego and pride daily and allow God to show you how life is to be lived. Always do the next right thing. Pray constantly!

I believe that the only barrier between man and god and between me and you is the human ego. It is the ONLY barrier!
@patrickmadrid Alcoholism is way deeper than alcohol. It's a sickness of the mind and spirit. I'm Catholic but In AA I found god
@patrickmadrid Alcoholism is a spiritual malady coupled with a physical allergy. Heavy use of pot is no different.
@SoberStill Sober after 85 days. I was dry for several years. (Untreated) Thanks to gods grace and AA I'm sober physically and spiritually
@asoberman Amen to that!
@SoberStill @TorontoStar Gotta gain that knowledge or the beast returns. I whiteknuckled for 8 years.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Prophetic much?? Ha ha!
@DonaldJTrumpJr They're on the way!
What a freaking game!! #Trump supporter wins again.#SuperBowl
@ROARK88 People that are spiritually sick get a kick out this kinda stuff.
@KGBVeteran We should round up these anti American fucks and ship them the fuck outta here!!!
@FaceTheNation @CBSNews We should! They have an obligation to protect speech on their campus. Milo should sue for civil rights violation.
@sullivanradio It's not that divided. The majority is just quiet and the media makes the screechers look numerous. Yawn
@Reuters Being a threat to a commie pig is a good thing!
@foxandfriends A politician crying. Lol! Put him up for the Oscars.
@DHSgov @POTUS About damn time there's some common sense floating around in our government!
@FoxNews So tired of these lefties telling us "who we are". Please just shut the hell up!!
@sullivanradio If it forces a change in our lifestyle so be it. We need to stand our ground and figure it out. That's America.
@foxandfriends California is a giant looney bin.
@Rambobiggs No it's emotion unchecked by reason. It's a mental midgetry.
@ABC7 @patrickmadrid Sounds like he's scared to fix his own problems. Whatever.
@TweetBrettMac I feel as guilty over whiteness as much as I feel guilty for bleeding red.
@TweetBrettMac White guilt is a notion made up by softheaded fools that will do anything for acceptance.
@DineshDSouza Abortion is murder. People that get abortions are murderers. Let that truth sink in.
@CNN Trump supporters work and Obama supporters suck from the basket of fruit of our labor. We're busy EARNING a living. Make sense?
@TheeCurrentYear @ROARK88 Let the lazy bums of society be shown in their full splendor.
Damn! Never thought this day would come. Let's do this America! #Trump45
@realDonaldTrump Amen! Consciously! Form the demand!
@CNN Worry about hormones and chemicals and stop worrying about GMO's. I beg of thee!!! Major over hyped fear.
Sober for 47 days now. It's the Trump effect!
@jaketapper Media sucks because their goal is viewership first. Removes the heart out of the profession. Plain and simple.
@jaketapper Too late. I'll never watch regular media again. It loves division and lies to accomplish it. Goodbye
@TweetBrettMac Don't judge too much. She's making a desperate request.
The world of spirituality is the only true reality. Once we accept this, we see the futility in self will. #Sobriety

@ScottBaio @HillaryClinton @ichadlowe @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @CNN A Hollywood political squabble. Hilarious!
@sullivanradio Deception is not decency. We've been lied to by supposedly decent people for 40 years. Go Trump!!!
@SoberByDesign Excited as heck! My sponsor, his sponsor and his sponsor and my pastor are accompanying me. Love abound. Blessed! Thank you!
AA STEP 3. Making a permanent commitment to God tonight. Scariest step for me because I have to abandon my will.
@DineshDSouza I realized she actually sucked when I saw her in Manchurian Candidate. Looks bad next to a real great actor like Denzel.
@ROARK88 Feels worse to feel like a leader when you're simply an egocentric narcissist living In fairytale land. Been there done that.
New Years Day with no hangover! A glorious thing! 30 Days tomorrow.
@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider Absolutely nobody cares about this!! Lol
@SoberStill Awesome! 23 days and probably about 7 hours.
@PorkShake Merry Christmas. God bless you!
@ingridcarlqvist @invdebpk0 You all must put a stop to this madness. Merry Christmas!
@sullivanradio Disgusting! We'd never in a million years do that to an Obama kid.
@SoberByDesign Day 18. Working steps with sponsor. Excited for new life. God is good.
@jaketapper Grief pornographer. That's CNN. You guys are disgusting .
@jaketapper @LorettaLynch @billclinton That's why we assumed corruption.
@jaketapper @LorettaLynch @billclinton Any lawyer with any sense whatsoever would know not to do what she did.
@sullivanradio Two words.... Lame Duck
@sullivanradio I almost shot a guy over a crack pipe in the waistband. During the tussle, it felt like a gun barrel. People have no clue.
@PorkShake Observation. Not projection.
@PorkShake Why so sensitive. Speaks volumes of what's inside you rather than the flaws of religion.
@PorkShake You'll come around someday. I was hardly evangelizing but I'd be more than happy to anytime.
@PorkShake @reddit You should work on that atheism thing though.
@sullivanradio Actually it's a beautiful story. There are selfless people among us. Fake or not! If it inspires so be it.
@sullivanradio If it takes the Russians to get truth out of our lying government, so be it!
One week ago today, I walked into my first AA meeting. Learned more about myself in 7 days than in 45 years. I'll never forget that day!

Yo it'd be super cool if someone would answer the phone at @LiquorStoreBar so I can not be locked out of my apartment for the weekend. 
Everything written on my shirt from last night is nowhere near legible, except @jennyhendy's signature and \"I love big cock\".
Of course I lost my keys
I love the bunny hop
I want the bar tender right here right now.

@iamjsmithh and if you don't care, then leave it be lmao. I was just making a point.
@iamjsmithh I didn't say I was offended, I said it was rude generally. But it IS common sense that girls look different without makeup.
@iamjsmithh common sense though
\"We'll be there in 20 min.\" Nope. I was right when I tweeted an hour. #typical
@iamjsmithh you said leading everyone to believe that 24/7, I'm just saying most people realize girls look different without makeup

So you're okay with gay people unless it's your kid right? \nStill homophobic, and the worst kind.
(cant take the midnight train cause im fuckin scared)
just a small town girl. Living in a racist, insensitive, sexist, homophobic world,
I woke up to pee and Cara had texted me 11 minutes ago so I texted her back and now she's coming home with a story to tell me
I try to stay off snapchat so I don't get sad that my friends are out doing stuff without me
@chloebelshe I'll keep it in a jar for u
There are a few things in life that I don't handle very well, alcohol, sex, and lying, so I stopped doing those things and im chillin
I shouldn't know this much about Wagner Moura but my mom loves him
He told the director that they shouldn't hire him because he couldn't speak any Spanish, so he went to Mexico for six months to learn
In fact: the man who plans Pablo Escobar is a very famous actor from brasil and my mom won't stop talking about him
I have so far spent eight hours of my day watching narcos and I feel nothing but joy
lil squishes of love
I have a feeling a lot of people in my life are evil
I wish I had a detector that could tell me who was evil and who wasn't
They are about to shoot a baby and I audibly yelled NO and started to sob
87% of you told me not to get a breast reduction but I'm still going to do it anyway because my back fucking hurts
https://t.co/CEB6pP902k
Cara wants to go clubbing tomorrow but I want to lay in bed so
I'm not getting out of bed for the next two days. Don't believe me? Just watch.
Thank god I don't drink anymore
I'm sorry to whoever has ever seen me drunk
Those who don't watch narcos will be so confused with my tweets and for that, I'm not sorry
\"Call me gorilla \"\nIs that your birth name
*the
That bitch has higher ratings, let's kidnap her\n\nPablo that is not there answer
\"Brazilians, best asses in the world, I promise you that\"\nThank u so much
I'll admit, I'm learning lots of Spanish from narcos
Amber wants to feel hope too
When u paint Cara a pair of boobs https://t.co/7x6xCH3Neg
You know when u get dressed for no reason
@zachthesack1 I didn't , I just wanted to feel hope for the first time since I was 3
If Cara forwards my call one more time
@zachthesack1 IM POOR AND CANT AFFORD MY BILLS, LET ME BELIEVE
When your coworker locks you out of the building, SICK
Also, I shouldn't be doing your work for you. I have other shit to do, fam.
Do your fucking job so I won't get in trouble
I need to work with adults, I can't stand people fucking around at work
So you don't wanna do work? Don't work here then
I can't drink alcohol anymore which means I have less tolerance for bullshit guys
Coworker I hate: you're just always in a bad mood Natasha\n\nMe: maybe if you weren't so irritating then I wouldn't be in such a bad mood
I had a dream that I got my Amazon refund and then I checked my account wen I woke up and it was still at $1.88
Dear manager, please stop having me close. It's too cold to ride my bike home. Thank you.

Stop ignoring your surroundings

@TinyHeiny one time I got famous for a minute and that was pretty sick
Reasons why I'm a walking trash can: my purse and pockets are filled with clock out receipts and cigarette butts
@TinyHeiny I ask myself that question every day
Hey friends, stop telling me about the sex that I'm not having too, I get it.
Real talk: would it be sad to play a board game by yourself?
On a real level though, how do you make new friends as an adult?
I texted my friend asking what she was doing. Her response, \"having sex\"\nMe: oh okay bye
I'm fucking over it
Everyone come into mod and buy pizza from me
@yalilnastyyy I always get full bc waist trainer
Two slices at mod is half a pizza guys
I just ate two slices of pizza and I'm still hungry what's wrong with me
On my tombstone it's gonna say: will you cover my shift?
When no one will cover your shift but you sprained your ankle and can't walk
Sprained my ankle and when I asked my boss what to do, she got upset and told me if I can't come in I have to get my shift covered
\"I'll be home by 2 at the latest\" HAHA

@razeaydakota comedic genius
Steve carell, man.
@zachthesack1 tfti
I just fell down the stairs
No one ever answers my texts but it's okay because I'll just pretend they did
Girls are crazy
@mrlspeed it's literally my screensaver
Honestly, probably a lot
I wonder how many times I've been cheated on and didn't know
I forgot that I worked out AND did yoga today, good job natasha

9 days sober
day 1- I accept
I was in the middle of yoga when my roommate stomps up the stairs and slams her door, namaste to you too
I ate eggrolls for breakfast
I think I need to get rid of social media
My roommate just got home six hours early and my mood just went to shit
You are not a burden
I cannot stress to you the importance of making friends who understand you and try to bring you up
How my friends view being thin is the perfect example of girls views on body image being skewed
I would break up with him in a second  https://t.co/FUjxFJWx2A
I know all of you are excited about the downpour and thunderstorms, but I have to ride my bike to work, I am not excited
You will be worth it to someone, I promise.
But if you happen to come across people who just want to use you, I hope you know when to walk away.
I hope you meet the right people in 2016, those who will appreciate you and wont take you for granted.
the first step to moving forward is admitting that you've been standing still
if you don't wanna suffer, then you better run
if you value your life, stay off the drugs\nif you value the drugs, stay off the map\nif you value them maps, you better travel soon
dipped my heart and hands in honey
stop giving yourself to people who don't deserve any ounce of you
Don't care about coachella. Is shakey graves playing? No. Is sylvan esso playing? No.
My heart hurts
Well I supposed to an aa meeting at 7:30 and then I looked out my window and thought, there's no way I'll survive on my bike out there
Just want someone to lay next to me and listen to shakey graves
Correction : flirted with me
I'll never forget the day shakey spoke to me
https://t.co/wvLhx7k6rT
I FIXED IT GUYS

update: my lip is swollen again
Update: took a shower, don't feel new. But I do feel clean
man this has been the worst life of my life
Someone come over and smoke cigarettes with me until I feel alive again
Let's be friends though
I'm going to shower and hope that I come out a new person
Looking back at the last month, I have made some real regrettable decisions
Yo I'm over having friends that are so far away
Took a nap to feel better and I woke up and felt worse. Well, I tried
Woke up, checked Twitter, and I'm over it
Don't be so offended that I deleted your number, I'm nothing to you ?

@ambersbitchin she knows you did acid
amber was halfway out my window blowing out smoke, I grab around her waist, hold her, and say, Big baby
I would just like to inform the twitter sphere that I don't care about football
\"but just to make sure, we arent going to get in trouble\"
when Siberian Husky plays gently with baby gives you a bad trip
watching a video called Siberian Husky plays gently with baby and amber goes, \"I dont like that\"
when amber is having a bad trip
when amber keeps trying to go to the darkside and your safe word is \"bad trip bad trip bad trip\"
what
amber: do you see them?\nme: see who?\namber: the candles, they are going to runaway
*watching a video about kwanzaa*\namber: is that what carly celebrates?\n\n.......
There's this other Natasha I met at Xxyyxx and I genuinely feel bad for her as a person
https://t.co/xHTFUplPbw
My acid trip is like enhanced right now
I'm so annoyed
@jeensprout yeah of course I do
@jeensprout no I threw it away
Xxyyxx for the second year in a row with my best friend
@cababexo as you should be
Xxyyxx tonight
Walking my bike up the hill is almost just as bad
I refuse to ride my broken bike with no gears up this hill without my inhaler. I'm fucking walking
I'm really sick of makeup https://t.co/cw2thj9EZs
@chris_calderonn same
You do not need to be posting six snapchat videos of you and your boyfriend with your tongue down each others throats
You got laid last night, we fucking get it
We get it, you had a New Years kiss
If I see any more videos of people having their New Years kiss I will scream
@chris_calderonn 
@chris_calderonn HAHA ALCOHOL
Pls https://t.co/4RG2VbT7tx
I am up
It is five am
I am laying in bed and I start hearing a robot speaking, then amber says, \"I have to do my fifteen minutes of Spanish\"
E is a weird drug, man
rolls
Amber has now gone upstairs to console a crying teenager and I am in the kitchen charging my phone
Amber made us uber here and now I can't drive home
Take me home
\"*talking about ecig juice* I was telling them how I like to put it on my tongue and it makes me numb\"
\"This is what I feel like doing *rolls around her eyes* \"
\"I've always wanted to be a Pegasus\"
Live tweeting Amber on xanax
I'm over New Years and I've only been out for 5 minutes
@mrlspeed I just realized I had a problem and it had nothing to do with New Years 
If anyone needs a sober driver tonight and can't drive their own car home, I will be available to help you out! Stay safe everyone!!
Three hours and twenty minutes until my shift is over and I become my friend's personal uber driver for the night
First meeting went well
I'm up
@chris_calderonn tell me how yours is after
@chris_calderonn soooo far
@chris_calderonn where da heck is yours

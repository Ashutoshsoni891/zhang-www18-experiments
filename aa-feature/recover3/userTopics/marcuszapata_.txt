@_emilyturnerr thank you for proving my point that much more Emily
@_emilyturnerr the menu says a price.... That's what I pay. No more then that
@_emilyturnerr I'm just sayin. People can't salty about not earning enough $$ cuz they don't get tipped enough. They should find another job
@Hailz_16 this explains so much... https://t.co/x9RqTAjxsF
When ppl say "if you can't afford to tip take ya ass to McDonalds" nigga stop complaining and find a real job &amp; go to school #ItsThatSimple

I'll never understand girls and their make-up.
@Rampage23_Ville for real. Some niggas are out there working full time and pulling it off
But pulling that off &amp;&amp; never going to class besides on exam day.... Y'all the true Legends
S/O to my followers that pull off that 4.0 every semester. Shit is the struggle for real
Tryna smoke a honey blunt by the river and Wang some chill shit. Just cuz I haven't smoked one since I was a kid
When every class is 97% and up, but you have that one solid ass B that is damn near impossible to get up to an A.  -__-

@_juannettee all I saw was like 3 names where I'd actually know and like to hear each and every one of their songs they'd perform
Sorry guys, I don't mean to be negative Nancy over here, but I was truly looking forward to soundset this year. My heart &amp; balls are broken

@FruTegomoh gotta make her a lil cloudy like the true OG's do
@marcuszapata_ yet them same girls be feminists making statuses about how cat-calling makes them feel inhumane/disrespected/uncomfortable
@marcuszapata_ seriously, yall ever read the comments on a girls photo. Like 20 girls be commenting like, "nice ass" "peep those titties"
Back in my day, guys could talk/flirt with girls. Nowadays you better have a vagina to tell a girl she pretty or else you're a thirsty creep
Luv only having class on Mondays &amp; Wednesdays &lt;3  #ScheduleMaster #DrunkOnAWednesday #WellTechnicallyThursdayNow :))))))
Chances are you watch my snap stories, but I don't watch yours :D
Someone spot me $30k so I can buy this maserati. Will pay back in sexual favors ;)
@_emilyturnerr Always have been :)
&amp; I don't mean gay people are lame. But like, I mean they like penis's, which from my opinion Id consider it lame to be infatuated w/ such
Not like it's literally "gay" but more like lame as hell
But then again, school is gay &amp; so is studying.
Idk why, but I started doing better in school when I stopped going to class and studying the textbook instead
@_emilyturnerr Emily your a good girl, you don't take synthetics lol
Weird I'm learning something in class and I haven't even taken an Addy yet today... #SoooWeird
@_03Ariii I never said I don't tip good servers. Hence why I said I hate when they think they are "entitled" to a tip for doing nothing
@_03Ariii all I'm saying is servers shouldn't expect tips unless they do their job right. Not bring me food and check back in an hour.
@_03Ariii ehhh, yeah I don't think that's gonna stop me. The restaurant industry should focus on fixing this issue with tipping.
@_03Ariii exactly my point. If they do their job correctly they do. But they are not "entitled" to a tip for bringing me food and that's it.
@_03Ariii but if no one tips then your checks would be regular sized right?
@shermanchar02 do you tip your uber ever?!?!
@marcuszapata_ real shit. Like if you want a tip, you better be damn near eating my food with me otherwise imma just just round up to the $1
I hate how waiters feel "entitled" to get a tip for a job that they are already getting paid for doing. Just grinds the fuck outta my gears.
@svennythelegend such a great feeling :)
Whoops! Just spilled half of my Addy and my roommate's parents' cat ate it....
Yall probs don't fux wit Cam Meekins but I fux wit his music heavy
Just feels like a good day to do some coke, idk
Was feeling myself last night and decided to do math until 5 in the morn. Shit hurts more then a hangover
@_emilyturnerr no they only go there to take selfies and vape
@_emilyturnerr well aren't you the shit
@marcuszapata_ her boyfriend wouldn't let me take a pic of her shirt :(
Just saw a bitch @ century wearing a shirt that said 'Take me to Paris' ... I have no words right now...

Anyone else notice a resemblance between Wiz's Bake Sale and GEazy's Order More?
You ain't balled on a budget unless you shop at Aldi's
Turkey bacon, adderal, and vodka is the new breakfast of champions
The fact that I'm making turkey bacon w/ breakfast rn because it's cheaper then regular bacon... Absolutely disgusts me

If you're not in cloud tonight you obviously have other plans #PointOutTheObvious2016
@PrinceKommotion dude I swear a hype man is like my calling haha
@PrinceKommotion bro I've turned up to your songs too many times. You gotta blow up and take me on the road already
I've been doing this thing where every time  I pregame at home I do my homework until I'm drunk enough. Really been getting A LOT done #alcy
@oh_haaiii_ley its the breakfast of champions
@oh_haaiii_ley I mean if you dance on a table tonight for me we could find out if I would or nah
On the other hand. I woke up sleazy, chugged a glass of wine, puked, smoked weed, and now I'm ready to rage
Hailey's mad at me for feeding the girl dancing on the table my last dollar using my mouth. She claims, "you wouldn't give me a dollar!"
@jimmymoney_ you have the worst luck with phones...
I never got how girls can kiss their friends. If any of my homies tried to kiss me they'd  be catching an uppercut without thought

@Kitty_C8 so I can't play eeny meet miny moe?!?
#tbt to when ripping shots on a school night was unforbidden

@oh_haaiii_ley I didn't want to lie. Honest Esteban has never told a lie
Got high and biked 4.1 miles through the snow to school.... Worst decision I've made in a while #WeedIsBad
Idk if there's a better way to state the point of a college degree if you ask me. Lmk if you have something better
People ask why college? What's the point? There isn't. You're basically paying for a bigger and better sign on your head that says "pick me"
Woke up 3 hours before my 9am cuz I'm so fricken stoked for school! Maybe I should get a little sleazy first ;)
Scrolling through Facebook seeing all these people in relationships like...."Ayy me too, that's wassup!"
Nothing worse then being up $500 dollars in blackjack and I end up leaving with the $20 I started... So damn frustrating !
@marcuszapata_ woke up to this. MLK day is lit
Pretty damn lucky if you'd ask me :)
Woke up sleazy. How lucky am I to move into a house where the owner just so happens to be a stoner &amp; fully functioning alcoholic
If only I would have known all my roommates would be gone all weekend ahead of time... Coulda prepared a party for y'all :/
@marcuszapata_ that way we both will learn lessons the hard way lol

Do people that make decisions based solely on what society deems as 'correct' have a fun/interesting life? Or do they just jack off a lot?

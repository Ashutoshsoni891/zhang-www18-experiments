Honestly dream come true last night watching @garthbrooks perform, what an amazing show!!
Good thing I pay for internet 150, and my wifi doesn't work half the fucking time... shaw is absolute garbage.
Up at 8 on my only day off
Seeing Garth brooks tomorrow, Metallica in august... all I need now is to see @DieAntwoord and my bucket list of musicians is done
When your Netflix goes down, and that's pretty well your whole fuckin life
I don't feel well at all... and I have a Garth brooks concert to attend to tomorrow
Shouldn't have to ask to get head, they should just do it .
Changed my phone plan to 8g of data ... if i go over now, I give up lol
I love the country life, idk why I'm going to look at a house in the city tomorrow
It seems I always have to fuel up on the coldest days #GasLightIsOn #TooColdForFuel
We won our dodgeball game tonight so that was sweet!
I hate working on F350's... like I'm not a heavy duty tech fuck off
Mexico in march .... much needed vacation! Fuck yaaaass
2017 is my year
Can't even remember the last time I stayed up till 2 hah
When you see your ex's twin sister on tinder you super like that hoe cause I'm nice like that hahaha
She calls me wreck it Ralph cause I destroy that pussy
Ugh banff was so much fun... can't wait to go back soon for my sled tour up in the mountains!
Alrightyyy time to hit the slopes!
T-1 hour till banff, can't wait to sit in the hot tub all night
Packing up for the mountains tomorrow!!
Road trippin with 3 girls, if I don't fuck one of them I'm just gonna end my life.
I'm only lookin for one thing, and I don't need a compass
Long weekend off and I'm stuck in bed sick... nice, 4 day work week then off to the mountains
When you're eating yummy food but you can't taste it... so sick
Got a fecking cold again.... like being sick for a month wasn't long enough
44 days sober holy shit... who knew.
Forgot my phone charger tho, so looks like I'm going without a phone all day and have to actually work...
I just love staying in Sherwood park, so much easier and I get to sleep in
Forgive me lord for I have sinned. I hit a 3rd gear jump 5th gear pinned
I just wanna wake up to booty pics is that too much to ask for
9 days till banff!! Much needed weekend away, can't wait for hot springs and shreddin fresh powww
1am can't sleep  hopefully my new pre workout does wonders
Merry Christmas to me! Ordering my lift kit this week
10 days till weekend in the mountains snowboarding!!!
I have a beard, and I lift.... why am I still single? Lol
3rd Christmas away from home
You know there's more to life than partying every night right? Try being sober for once and getting your priorities straight...
Being single is awesome like I have so much more money for truck parts!!
On a better note.... 18 days till I'm shredding in lake Louise!!
Gosh I make some stupid decisions when I'm lonely... at least I don't have booze clouding my judgement anymore.
Alrightyyy up in 4 hours for the gym
I'm gonna regret staying up all night playing chel
Nothing like blaring Motley Crue to start the day
Up at 8 on my last day off  guess I shouldn't go to bed so early lol
32 days sober, 3 days no darts!! Feels great
Bought a vape... only had 3 darts today compared to a pack, I'd say I'm doing alright
Went down on this girl last night and I'm pretty sure I seen her soul leave her body when she was cumming hahahahah
25 days not a drop of booze  feeling so happy and healthy
Slept in and missed church this morning
-35 no thanks I think I'll stay inside today
Tired, cold, sick ... winter sucks I'm over it lol fuck you alberta for being so windy
I might actually get more than 4 hours sleep tonight... deeeeecent!
I realllllly don't wanna go outside when it's -30
Was gonna go to bed early but instead I was binge watching @IcePilotsNWT
Sunday funday success... crushed it at the gym, went to the oilers game
Funny how I'm sober yet I still look drunk haha ... good time at the oilers game! jaebooth https://t.co/w7FuOpI7lL
First time at @RogersPlace for an @EdmontonOilers game! Pumped.. love the new arena
DQ, and Mario cart ... my best kind of date night
My girlfriend whooped my ass in Mario cart, so I made her give me a back rub... who really won? Lol
I don't wanna brag or anything but my pecs are like rocks, guess gym is paying off lol
When you realize you've had the biggest crush on @AllieReville for like 6 years
I can't believe @garthbrooks is coming to Edmonton!!! I literally got teary eyed when I found out!
 just so happy lately
So my boss called me a slut today... I was gonna argue with him but I figured that was a pretty accurate statement
2 weeks sober... Surprise surprise I'm doin it !!
When u see a hot girl and think to yourself... I would cum in you sooo hard hahaha
Woke up at 3, drove 4 hours, snowboarded allllll day, drove another 4 hours.... I'm exhausted

Not overly excited to leave at 3 in the morning tomorrow  but stoked for boarding in the mountains!!!

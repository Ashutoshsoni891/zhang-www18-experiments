@kateleth that book and the recording are epic.

This babe is breaking his #comiccon cherry as a vendor/artist on Saturday.
Tomorrow means last minute con shopping, errands, and table setup. I honestly can't believe I pulled this off and that its all happening.
@moriahpariah nooooo!
I caved and emptied the dishwasher. My hatred of dirty dishes and a messy kitchen won over my irritation of roommates immaturity.
In other news, I'm reminded of someone I miss dearly. I wish you hadn't left, Krista. You are missed. #NationalSuicidePreventionWeek
This is why I shouldn't have roommates and/or young 20-something roommates.
Not sure where they put the dishes, because the dishwasher is full and clean, which they refuse to empty. Why make more work for yourself?
Politely asked roommate to clean kitchen. I did my part earlier. They come home and deep sighed the entire time they \"cleaned\".
Dear @paypal, if I tell someone I go by 'Zeller', your rep should not then proceed to use the incorrect name 5 times. Even after correcting.
Ice cream for breakfast is how you adult, right? good.
You're turning violet, Violet! http://t.co/wCnzMe7DMa
@aredridel shit. I'm doing it wrong.
@eringraceburns I think so!
@moriahpariah I'm too emotional for life.
#WIP of some redone #icons. More of a paper craft feel, ditching the harsh outlines, keeping the cuteness. http://t.co/tu8OTddw4W
@millsartmuseum @eringraceburns This looks awesome!
@framingdoors uh oh. text me. or call. here if you need. also, props need to take a benadryl.
@framingdoors I'm going to sadly say allergic reaction. Don't die! I love you.
dirty dishes are still sitting in the sink, greeted by new ones. I unloaded the dishwasher. Roommate caught his gf's flu. She's just lazy.
You know you're either an illustrator and/or old when: you get excited that your carpal tunnel brace was delivered.
Welcome back to Anubis, iOS 9. I like you. (all my devices have Egyptian gods names)
@thiswildidea more like \"I love your work! Will you give me something awesome for free? Think of the exposure!\"
@aredridel I don't get enough retweets for it to matter. but my battery lasts a good 2 days.
Okay, back to bed now that the apple event is over.
@rockstar_ please no. I'm hungry and bored.
This apple event has taught me one thing: I just need a sugar daddy. problem solved :P
@omgitsrob shut up and take my money, apple.
I dont care about this, but I want to listen because your voice is like hummingbirds and rainbows and puppies.
Dear @Adobe, you just tried to say women need to smile more. NOPE. WRONG. #AppleEvent
@rockstar_ @moriahpariah if Illustrator was on there, I'm in.
@rockstar_ @moriahpariah That's fair. What would tip it over to \"totally replacing this\"?
@moriahpariah @rockstar_ dude. It could totally replace it. AND be more compact and portable.
I feel like having Microsoft on stage is making Steve Jobs roll over in his grave. #AppleEvent
@tbreisacher it's a date. :-)
Went through and deleted a bunch of tweets. Found ones that reminded me how much I miss someone who isn't in my life anymore. fuck feelings.
@tbreisacher I just finished it!
@gesa thank you! 
This. This is amazeballs. https://t.co/TYQYwkUEJy #loveisabattlefield
@gesa can I retweet this? This is amazing.
@gracecellis I'm writing a blurb about Lumberjanes for tomorrow's pull-list day, but I have to stop typing \"intern grace\" :P
@onebrightlight FACT.
@eringraceburns my kingdom for some southern food.
@adambeaugh I had this realization all weekend.
Pet peeve: not unloading the dishwasher that's clean, and just piling dirty dishes in both sinks. Clean up after yourself.
@thiswildidea Awesome choice. Infinite Monkey Theorem is delicious.
They let #KimDavis out of jail, so she now thinks she won. Way to go folks. You've created a monster. Still lost: her ability to do her job.
@desjardins hah. I don't think that's a T enlightened realization. I mean, you used to have a BMW. And girls like racing at stop lights too.
@desjardins you'll even out at some point. I can cry now, and really sad or emotional movies will make me sob.
@onebrightlight @JollibeeUSA @tbreisacher Couple of babes 
@desjardins yep. T will definitely do that. Took me a good year to cry more than a tear. However, if it's really big, there will be tears.
You guys! Badges for Fort Collins Comic Con sold out!! SOLD OUT! I can't believe it.
I wish there was a donut and coffee delivery service. I would be all over this today.
@moriahpariah don't overthink it! just pop on some good music and knock it out.
@desjardins I don't buy it. not one bit.
@moriahpariah rad studio in Denver called Processus. Etching press, dark room, and tools for sculpture.
OH: \"Do I smell like poop?\"
Positive thing I just learned: there's a studio in Denver now where I could join and make some sweet prints.
I received mail from my high school. It was addressed to \"Mr. Zeller Ash\", and it was good. Too bad they just want money. Haha. Nope.
@KallieWinners im eating Oreos for dinner.
Also, if you're a cis man who thinks contraception is \"morally wrong\", that's a hard pass.
@tbreisacher yeah. that would do it. Or just cute photos without the \"look at me, I can do this one legged pose on the edge of a lake\"
If your OKC profile has a photo of you doing an intense yoga pose, up in the mountains, I will pass. You're probably great, but I love pizza
@desjardins How's Milwaukee queer wise? Living in a smallish town here sucks. Denver doesn't seem to be much better.
Dating as a queer trans guy sucks sometimes. And by sometimes, I mean all the time.
@phirephoenix @naxuu I'm not actually a 20something. I wonder if any of my feed is. maybe a handful.
@naxuu @desjardins @phirephoenix @J_Breeze oh hey, I can see what's going on now. :P
@rockstar_ random, but have you seen some of the 3d printed watch bands? I found them while looking up a Magic Mouse palm rest.
@sfemonster well hello, handsome.
@desjardins haha nope. add a few years. I'm in the 30something category.
@desjardins @naxuu haha. you're sweet, but I'm not a 20something.
@moriahpariah @rockstar_ I've always wanted one. that's awesome!
@desjardins @naxuu I can't see the original tweet. Why am I rad?
accurate representation of when someone loses interest but doesn't say why. just bails. http://t.co/2IwLKk6g0g
@desjardins Pizza!
@moriahpariah solid. yes. I approve of this. I wish I had some donuts now.
@moriahpariah I know your pain. Emergency chocolate and bacon may help. :P
@moriahpariah Roommate has the flu. I heard him ask them how they were feeling, but instead of words, sobbing happened instead.
For those of you outside of Fort Collins, I added prints to my Society6 store! http://t.co/vnATGTbmKr
@harbingercoffee I would be completely okay with gray hairs. More wisdom for us!
@desjardins damn. hugs.
@desjardins :-( they actually said that?
My beard is finally starting to get darker on my chin. I found a few new dark hairs while exfoliating. Grow little guys, grow!
@desjardins proud of you. it's a big step. you did good, kid. :P
@desjardins Positive side: Could've gone worse! They'll learn that it's not something they can shove under a rug in time.
Roommate has the flu. I'm locking myself in my room. Send bacon.
@vesaldi @transboycliche I thought it was \"Aydan\" :P
@desjardins may the force be with you.
While I appreciate roommate finally emptying the dishwasher, 7:30am on a Sunday is not the time. Thanks, for waking me up &amp; slamming doors.
@desjardins Fingers crossed on the voice change. Mine did get sore. I also noticed I lost my voice more easily when it was changing.
@moriahpariah I have plenty. Come and take some away.
@hcatlin I thoroughly enjoy your podcast.
I think my next project will be oddities. Jarred creatures and bones and fun things like that.
I don't know what's up with this weekend and getting bailed on continuously, but I give up.
@desjardins keep an eye on it. could be a reaction. maybe switch it up and apply on stomach?
the French flirting lessons on duolingo are terrible. \"do you come here often?\" and \"are you a model?\"
@karimarie_ I applaud you. (as I say from bed)
Hey, #harrypotter fans. You can order Pumpkin juice from Starbucks. For grande: 2 pumps Pumpkin Spice Syrup, fill with apple juice + ice.
hahaha first time meeting your boyfriend's parents. cute.
OH: \"What do your parents think about makeup? What kind of impression do shorts make? What about pants? Are your parents usually on time?\"
OH: (yelling) \"You can tell me more when I'm done pooping.\" Inside voices, people. I don't need to know about your bowel events.
Oh man, thrilling night. I read and drank root beer while having a hot bath. If that's not sexy, I don't know what is. #jknotsexyatall
Reading about biohacking and magnet implants. Little known fact: Something I've been very interested in for years.
@tbreisacher Luckily, the ban is only for August. Hopefully, normal cilantro garnishing will resume.
@tbreisacher It is! But because the FDA did a partial ban due to health concerns and an outbreak.
OH: (yelling and whining) \"Alex! There's a hole in my pants pocket!\" cool story, bro. His reaction was a nicer version of \"cool story\".
@tbreisacher I did indeed. I could go on all night about the ridiculousness that comes out of their mouth.
@feastingfc @rockstar_ That just makes me cringe.
@moriahpariah @rockstar_ I feel you. I have some folks like that.
@rockstar_ haha that and the \"natural habitat\" photo.
@feastingfc Something! It's dark and looks so unappealing.
@rockstar_ @moriahpariah You are not a joke. Don't feed off that negativity. Unless to be AMAZING and show how bad ass you are.
OH: \"Cilantro is in short supply because of a bad season. Something to do with run off.\" NOPE.
Hearing the roommate talk about \"traditional mexican cuisine\" as if they knows anything about it. They work at Chipotle.
@tbreisacher haha. I definitely didn't read that tweet correctly. Brain is mush.
@tbreisacher Fact.
@tbreisacher only in caps? I'm bad at saying \"oh\" a lot.
@feastingfc Ha. Ha. Ha. Oh my. Also, the second tweet down makes me cringe. That photo. Just no.
@yukarishinohara thanks!
@hcatlin nooooo!
I made myself a cute little logo. http://t.co/KUaEIXObcP
@rockstar_ only decision I'm making today is what pizza to order, and that I'm staying home today.
@rockstar_ eh. it's not a new realization. just a confirmation.
Today is one of those, \"I don't want to get out of bed\" days. Realizing good friends aren't actually good friends hits hard.
@transboycliche I worried about that too. luckily, I just became more queer.
@FeastingFC @rockstar_ this is true. I've accepted that if I need to sleep away the day, it's okay and to not beat myself up about it.
@rockstar_ @FeastingFC story of my life as well.
@transboycliche excite bike
@hcatlin I can't even. appropriating civil rights photos for their cause?! oh hell no.
@desjardins T is a blot clotter, yes. but I also get muscle aches, especially after my shot sometimes.
@desjardins good that you called the doc.
@thiswildidea Those smothered and covered hashbrowns. Reminds me of late nights after printing in Bergen.
Let's not turn #KimDavis into the martyr she hopes to become. It boils down to a gov't official not doing their job and breaking the law.
@desjardins why do you think it's something clot related?
@desjardins are you predisposed to clots?
@BrianVisaggio yep. it does. Captain Phasma!
Happy Force Friday!! #MayTheForceBeWithYou
How did I go from being awake all night, to wanting to go to bed at 9:30pm? Oh. Maybe it was the queso and tacos.
@sfemonster I just want some cuddles and someone to eat pizza with me while we binge watch netflix. But also, alone time.
@sfemonster preach. yes.
@rockstar_ I also cried from joy.
@moriahpariah OMG YESSSSSSSSS x100 million.
@tbreisacher music to my ear holes.
@nigeldynamite past history aside, she is an elected official. Therefore, must carry out the laws regardless of personal beliefs.
Pre-transition spam: online driving school, Nigerian Prince money scam, Post-transition spam: Erection cures, penis enlargement
I was awake during normal hours today. I think I'll reward myself with some Marvel Heroes. Deadpool needs a kill fest.
@danetheeegreat very true. You mean no ragrets :P I chose Placebo.
@danetheeegreat I usually wallow. Hence my \"I haz a sad\" spotify playlist.
@brianvisaggio @moriahpariah @rockstar_ no such thing.
THEY'RE HERE! Today has been a fantastic day and it's only 2:30! Prints, jobs, pizza, and comics! Doesn't get much better than that.
THEY'RE HERE! Today has been a fantastic day and it's only 2:30! Prints, jobs, pizza, and comics! Doesn't get much better than that.
this is happening today! #ladykiller even though I have all the single issues. http://t.co/mOnTKz7XeA
cutting my own hair was an epic success, and the only thing a camera on an iPad is good for. (a makeshift mirror) http://t.co/MxwKutaRPT
@desjardins haha. it's not my first time with a mohawk. I've had them at corporate offices too.
I just had a prank call. Dear kids in Loveland, get a hobby.
@desjardins proactiv is OTC.
@desjardins haha welcome to puberty 2.0. I now use proactiv, because acne is a thing. Mine evened out after a year.
@transboycliche I am an embodiment of those stereotypes. formerly identified as a lesbian, now queer as hell for guys.
Why did I just watch an entire One Direction music video? Oh yeah, in hopes that the space theme meant they had a one-way ticket.
@vancityreynolds only if this is a metaphor for sending boy bands on a one-way trip to space.
@ceeweb yes.
I call this, \"Photo Booth portrait of waking up\".. aka, every day life with this cat. http://t.co/3h3EhdGGTQ
Today will be the day I pick up my long overdue pull list. And hope that Gryphon didn't give up on me :P
@melgillman good list but could've been better!
@kateleth there's nightmare before Christmas ones?! I need these in my life.
@autostraddle This list is great, but you also left off some big and fantastic queer, non-binary, or trans comic artists.
snapchat tried to tell me an ex had friended me, but in app there were no signs of it. weird.
Comic Con prints have shipped! I made some extra special 16 x 20 prints for con. Because who doesn't love zombies?!
@BrianVisaggio related to previous tweet.
The trans community doesn't need another white, privileged, assimilating into hetero society icon. Esp not one with shady business practices
Laughable moment of when someone favorites a tweet without reading your negative reply.
@moriahpariah not bad and eat it up.
@hcatlin over an hour?! Gross.
I couldn't fall back asleep, so now I'm back to binge watching the show that gave me nightmares. Because I'm a glutton for punishment.
@desjardins No. I started to get squeaky voice every now and then. Cold-like voice around 2 weeks. Some stuff can be placebo effect vs. real
@desjardins how often?
@desjardins What's your dose?
I think in my head, I fell asleep writing a screenplay. Meryl Streep was going to be the witch. But then my mind just put me in it.
I had a nightmare about a witch trying to kill me. Felt like I was choking on vines &amp; woke up feeling like I was choking. So I'm awake now.
@desjardins Haha. Don't get me started. First mistake is wanting to be like @AydianDowling
Roommate woke me up with annoyingly loud whistling. You wouldn't like it if I was loud at 4am when you're trying to sleep.
@desjardins pics are good. Patience, young padawan.
@translabyrinth @nbchannibal very sad about this ending. It was so good.
@tbreisacher haha nope. I'm good on that front.
Vampire Diaries season 3: where they put too much makeup on Damon.
@tbreisacher hahahaha I wish. I'd probably make her cry.
dear roommates, use inside voices. you're not the only ones who live here. I get it. for the 15th time. Your cold makes you unable to taste.
@desjardins alcohol works against T, for the record. It can inhibit T synthesis among other things. It wasn't the T, it was a strong drink.
@desjardins Pro tip: it wasn't the T.
@desjardins can't tell if you're joking or serious.
@tbreisacher totally agreed.
Getting back in bed. After spilling my plate of hot food into my lap, I dropped a roll of TP in water, stubbed my toe, and spilled coffee.
and then I dumped the plate of food in my lap, while cutting into it.
over easy eggs, roasted tomato and artichoke stuffed mushrooms, and stumptown cold brew. yes.
@desjardins Did you eat anything that could cause it? like asparagus or cabbage?
I m reminded why I prefer night time. Grocery shopping on a Saturday morning was the worst idea ever.
@tbreisacher pretty much. But saying a hot food is \"Paleo beef\" and then putting potatoes in it is laughable.
@desjardins it may be something else, especially with androgel. T is slow acting, and androgel is a much smaller dose.
Hahaha whole foods thinks white potatoes are Paleo. Nice try, champ.
@omgitsrob Hahaha eh. I'm obsessed with Kate Winslet, and have been since I was 13. We all have someone.
@omgitsrob Haha it sounds like it. Why?!
@omgitsrob Selling overpriced, cheap sex toys at an overrated toy shop. :P Tattoos still win. always.
@omgitsrob tattoo wins. always.
@desjardins most likely the caffeine.
@desjardins he's very good. But there are plenty of other fantastic surgeons as well.
I've been awake for 3 hours, but I want to sleep more. Maybe this will fix my weird schedule.
I woke up at 10pm. What fresh hell is this?
@desjardins eh. Doubtful. But maybe the routine part! I don't mind the weird hours as long as I continue to get decent sleep
@desjardins I've always had sleep issues. The vampire schedule is mostly a product of not having a routine anymore.
Juuuust kidding. Can't fall asleep, so I'm waiting for Xanax to kick in. My brain goes a mile a minute about the most random things.
Apparently my chest is a prime sleeping spot. This is what I get for letting her sleep there as a kitten. http://t.co/ss0VrE32mK
@altonbrown tampopo! Such a great film.
@rockstar_ you can do it!
I can't even. Do they even pay attention to what they favorite? http://t.co/87cV7chNkH
@hcatlin 'merica. where the burger is more important than women.
It's incredibly frustrating when folks don't act like decent humans. If someone tries to clear the air, don't return it with more attitude.
I really hope people like my stuff and buy prints. My OCD nature means the prints themselves will be great, but what if no one likes them?
@brianvisaggio you and me both.
I did it. I finished all prints. I hope people like them!
With comic con coming up, I didn't want [dead name] to be shown on receipts or anything. I expected hassle and headache.
Epic win for @Paypal! I needed to change my name to my legal middle name, explained trans status. They did it! Thank you x100!
figuring out how to save up/make enough money for a Cintiq. I would draw ALL DAY LONG with that thing.
Not a bad thing, mind you. Just an interesting observation. I feel like I fit finally (for the most part). It's become an afterthought.
I've reached a point in my transition where I forget to do my shot sometimes. It used to be a novelty and exciting, now it's just normalcy.
@desjardins I went with shots because insurance covered it and it was less expensive.
@tbreisacher you can't unfollow @CuteEmergency. it's too good.
@tbreisacher haha I can definitely add something happier for your day. ;-)
I saw a post about it being Wednesday. had to check my calendar. yep, it really is Wednesday. I definitely didn't know what day it was.
@moriahpariah moar purple!
@moriahpariah that's awesome! on both accounts.
@moriahpariah i want to favorite this a million times. can we do a print swap??
@moriahpariah yessssssasssssss!!!!!!!!
it's been a busy night! reinventing an old design, creating type, and making that hand look https://t.co/5DolcjcDic
Plus side: I'm getting a credit from @comcast. Downside: I had to battle for over an hour with ignorant reps.
Once again, I am battling @comcast chat reps, because my internet doesn't work again.
@avery_tye maybe it's time to find a new doctor.
Tonight, I finished my last print for comic con. Inking is already done, so I just need to do color and lettering.
@FeastingFC I will on a rare occasion eat a roll with cream cheese. For the most part I love simple and classic rolls or nigiri.
@moriahpariah gorgeous! And it makes me want a cintiq so much more!
@FeastingFC NO. Just no.
I sent my mom a gif, and she asked why there wasn't any sound.
@laurajanegrace everyone doesn't already do this? damn.
I now have 5 prints done! 5! Only one more to go!
I am missing Deftones at Red Rocks. This makes me v. sad.
@moriahpariah cheez-it grooves with cream cheese, peanuts, oreos mega stuffed, la croix, popcorn, yogurt with granola, celery and ranch.
@moriahpariah I got out of bed for cereal. And then got back in bed.
Came across someone from my old job on scruff. Chuckled because I recognized building exterior in his shot.
@desjardins gotta be positive. I know it's hokey, but positivity brings positivity.
@moriahpariah Choco looks so sweet. I only see him hating me :P
@desjardins @snugglepolish That'll help too. I'll keep my fingers crossed!
@desjardins @snugglepolish If the clinic offers informed consent, the chance of getting it is higher that day.
@desjardins @snugglepolish I got my script at my first doctor visit.
@moriahpariah fair enough. I do recommend 'if i stay'. but be prepared to sob.
I'm giving myself a Wednesday deadline to have all 6 prints done and off to the printer.
@moriahpariah whyyyyy??
@melgillman I could get behind this.
Well, that was cathartic. I've known her for 12 years. She's my ex fianc. Good to reconnect and chat about life. And flash her my chest.
A very old friend is coming to have dinner with me. I don't know why I'm nervous, she knows me better than most people.
While crawling into bed, I found a darth vadar mouse toy. Very glad that Leia is not an outdoor cat, and that it wasn't a real mouse.
In my current re-discovery of my love of classical music, I discovered that the Colorado Symphony is performing my 2 favorite works ever.
@tbreisacher hahaha. I love the \"not all named Aiden\"
Sometimes you just need to drown out the thoughts with music. And that's okay.
I just watched \"if I stay\". I've been sobbing like an idiot for a good 30 minutes. Fuck. That was heavy.
Once I asked that blatant question, he realized it was stupid. I said RA's and RD's are trained to help with conflicts/mediation if needed.
The amount of pure ridiculous ignorance tonight was overwhelming. I need queer self care. There should be Queers Anonymous support groups.
A guy asked me what his freshman nephew should do if his (gay) roommate is attracted to the nephew. I said \"are you attracted to all women?\"
@tbreisacher hugs are always welcome. :-)
@sarrhansen barf 
@sfemonster I volunteer as tribute.
Out with people from Ingress. One guy just made a joke and used the word \"tranny\". I want to punch something. I'll let you guess what.
I only have 1 print left to ink! 2 done totally. 3 need various amounts of shadows. Productive night. Now, I sleep.
@snugglepolish good to know! I just have to get some more freelancing going, so I can go to the doctor. Also, def ADD meds. Am now shaky.
Things I'm #obsessed with tonight: guac and bacon together, Placebo's cover of \"Running Up That Hill\", and La Croix Cran-Raspberry.
Then she flirted and unintentionally followed me to other parts of the store. Said she wasn't trying to, joked that I now have a stalker.
cute girl in grocery store said I smelled great. Almost blown away by how good I smelled. I took it as a compliment and said thank you.
@snugglepolish makes sense. I don't draw by hand every day.
@snugglepolish oh interesting. I don't have insurance, so I can't go see him for the time being. But when I can, I'll check into it!
Roommate is yelling about ridiculous customer requests at their job. You work in food service, it's going to happen. Grow up.
@snugglepolish Yep. ADD meds, but I didn't take it yesterday. Those do make my hands shake all day, which is hard as an illustrator.
@nurse_nurse This is so good!
@nurse_nurse is this on Netflix or online by chance?
I should probably figure out why my hands shake all the time. Can't be a good sign.
Working on some teef details. This fly needs some floss! https://t.co/AK9Tn5dX8z
@desjardins haha. my go-to there is a triple venti soy caramel macchiato. I make it manly ;-)
@desjardins If by blood, you mean Mt. Dew code red.
@desjardins Hahah I will :P
@desjardins I've accepted my vampire state.
@desjardins thanks!
I am now the proud owner of http://t.co/up6AFzF0rC and it made my day. Now, I'm really going to sleep.
Goodnight, world. This vampire is going to sleep in my coffin now.
@hcatlin hahahaha yessss!
@hcatlin @astrokatie @romeroabelleira I found it last night. ;-) At least they didn't mention you by name? still ugh though.
@moriahpariah because you're smart. that's why you bring a bag of bacon.
It's 4am, and I'm watching videos of blackheads and cysts being removed. WHY?
@hcatlin wait, what?!
@hcatlin preach!
@BrianVisaggio not at all.
@brianvisaggio #teamgarnet
@KallieWinners welcome to the club.
@lelak I don't know! maybe?
Jaimie Alexander is killing it in this Blindspot pilot. KILLING IT. I can't wait to see more.
Throwback to 2007: I worked for the UNF LGBT Resource center and helped bring @katebornstein to campus. Pre-T baby Z http://t.co/aB2kz8LTZh
@moriahpariah You have way more than just 1 person. Keep at it. Your work is great.
I don't want to be \"normal\". Because what is \"normal\" anyways? #IAmCait
\"Ask: That's the first step of being a good ally.\" @katebornstein Yessss. THIS. #IAmCait is getting some good realness.
I love that @katebornstein points out that a lot of the world does think we as #trans folks are freaks. Auntie Kate brings the realness.
@danetheeegreat solid question.
@moriahpariah it was so amazingly delicious.
@ErinGraceBurns my eyes just rolled so hard.
my #bacon beats your bacon. double smoked for extra tastiness. http://t.co/zf1N6yiOqc
PSA: Quills is now available on #Netflix. if you haven't seen it before, watch it!
@ErinGraceBurns @jbante yep! I cannot handle the excitement about this. It is so great.
@ErinGraceBurns #strugglecuddle
Apparently this is how we're napping today. She keeps lifting and biting my hand so I will pet her. http://t.co/6jind0qJCo
You know I care about you as a friend if I choose brunch with you in Denver instead of sleeping. Now, I need sleep. My eyeballs hurt.
Apparently, I'm still a moderator for a kate winslet livejournal community. who knew!
@rockstar_ I might have some possibilities to send your way.
@rockstar_ What is your specialty?
No one wants to hear ducks quacking repeatedly, let alone as an alarm for an hour.
Roommate has had 2 alarms going off every 10 minutes for the last hour. Get the fuck up.
@hcatlin preach!
Learning to let go is hard, but I deserve better. Friendship should never be one sided, and it shouldn't cause you heartache or pain.
@desjardins super proud of her!
Finally, a semi-productive night. Worked on learning more jQuery, added 30 proposals to @thewordset, applied for jobs, watched some Hannibal
@bigticketshop haha thanks. Sadly, it's a US show, not a UK one.
Reminding myself to not read the comments. I spent an hour doing just that, and now I just feel sad.
@hcatlin I don't know if that's creepy or awesome.
@elisawikey snaps to this.
I actually cooked for the second day in a row. Drastic improvement. Tonight was jalapeo bacon burger with oven fries.
@moriahpariah I will gladly take hugs. Also, when can I see you bout with the new team?
I cannot stop laughing: https://t.co/RwxVsU166E
@rockstar_ @snugglepolish I just woke up! And now I'm laughing uncontrollably about hot snakes.
@snugglepolish @rockstar_ I didn't expect that, and almost spit out my coffee.
I bought a ticket to see CHVRCHES in October, hoping I know at least one person going so I don't feel like the weirdo alone.
I was never a big fan of Gillian Anderson in the X-Files era, but her roles in The Fall and Hannibal are awesome. She is stunning.
@framingdoors :-(
@comcastcares They are still an issue. And reaching out 3 days after a tweet is posted is a bit ridiculous from a social media perspective.
This made me laugh a whole lot, out loud, by myself. https://t.co/Gelpw1IFOi
@desjardins I haven't been to bed yet. your tweet made me think today was Wednesday because I can't read apparently.
@yukarishinohara you should! I'm on season 2. It's pretty good!
@yukarishinohara have you watched Hannibal?
@aredridel I just see work that I'm in awe of, and know I'm not at that level yet.
Sometimes I feel like a fraud, like my illustrations or design work is a joke. Tonight is one of those nights.
I have to admit, #Lucifer pilot is everything I wanted it to be. Witty, snarky, and fabulous. I was even an ounce of his suave demeanor.
@omgitsrob yes. yes it is.
@omgitsrob this was the best I could do without blatantly being an asshole. http://t.co/8v99ImAReE
@omgitsrob haha I'll see what I can do.
roommate is pulling the same passive aggressive dishwasher stunt again. piling dishes in sink. It's their turn to put away clean dishes.
@desjardins don't beat yourself up. mistakes happen.
Lucifer pilot was leaked. I know what I'm watching later!
@desjardins I wouldn't say never. I feel like they hype up the whole \"can a woman do it\" thing.
@adambeaugh step away from the phone.
my roommate shaved the back and sides of their head, but kept weird patches on the sides. WHY?!
@desjardins oh I don't care.
@desjardins I got excited, but it doesn't start for an hour here.
I want vegetables, but I am also entirely too comfy in pjs, under this super soft blanket.
@desjardins same with my dad. stubborn and hard to change.
@desjardins NICE! My mom hasn't even done that in 10 years. props to your mom.
@desjardins haha fair enough!
@desjardins That's cool. Honestly, my mom won't read it if I send it to her. They've known for 10 yrs now.
@desjardins She can put it on an iPad or kindle. It'll read like a book.
@rockstar_ online chat. I gave up and at the end ripped them a new one. Because 2 hours + no help = angry z.
@desjardins I gave my mom a book that she didn't actually read, I don't think. I do post a lot on my Facebook, and I know she sees that.
Well, that's 2 hours of my life I will never get back. An unresolved issue remains unresolved until I go to the local service center.
Oh hey! It's been over an hour, and I am STILL chatting with @comcast. Oh joy.
Dear @comcast, If I have an issue, don't try to sell me something. Just fix the issue.
Then, surprise! It will raise my bill. Because the promised 105mbps speed he's offering is an additional charge. Just fix the issue.
My level of being pissed off right now is way above a 10. First, he says my modem needs to be replaced and that it will cost nothing.
The best way to get me fired up at 5:30am: deal with @comcast and their absolutely terrible customer service.
@framingdoors Just let it happen.
Albus decided to play fight instead of enjoy his bath. The stink eye Leia is giving him right now: priceless. http://t.co/o1E67C8Jiq
I went to Old Town to play Ingress. Lasted about 15 minutes, because I forgot I live in a college town. It was pretty awful.
I'm turning into a hermit or vampire. Or both. Send Surge and Chinese food.
@moriahpariah @KseniaSolo solid goal!
@moriahpariah I am avoiding it but secretly I really want to watch it.
I just woke up. I'm watching Difficult People, which is amazing, and drinking coffee. I've accepted my night owl status.
@framingdoors you do you, boo.
Thanks to the lovely and wonderful thingslikestuff, I now have merman hair.  https://t.co/wTkRw70jcn
I'm now a merman, with purple, blue, and teal hair. Rad.
@geekygirlsarah what?! Are they younger than ~25?
@SnugglePolish @desjardins I would find a new doc. I see mine every 3-6 months, but in the beginning it was more often.
@moriahpariah Haha true. Okay. Sleep time.
@moriahpariah Yeah. But they should also realize that there's a human on the receiving end who will help as much as they can. No guns blazin
@moriahpariah agreed. I don't miss that part. They're even worse on social media. They forget that a person is on the receiving end.
@moriahpariah you're basically a verbal punching bag all day.
@kateleth Why is that?
@sfemonster obviously they have the wrong priorities.
@adambeaugh At least a dozen. Maybe more.
Oh, hell yes. https://t.co/dmrDm9CGOx #deadpool
@adambeaugh YESSSSSS!!!
@adambeaugh Bastards! I'll already be awake, but damn it! I want it nooww! (*cue Veruca Salt voice*)
@adambeaugh Just kidding.
@adambeaugh Here you go: https://t.co/bubhTIv20P
@adambeaugh Oooh tonight?! Now I'm going to look for a leak.
@adambeaugh yes plz
@moriahpariah @rockstar_ I don't have his number. Paul, would you want random smiley faces gracing your wrist? :-P
My new soulmate. While charging, I noticed how used to it I am already. I also love Lifeline the game on it. http://t.co/mn9OR3Yy5E
So I got an Apple Watch. Now, I just want to send little drawings to people, but @moriahpariah is the only friend I know with a watch. :-(
@quirkyrican mostly, I just like to stand after sitting for hours.
@SnugglePolish @desjardins it's not ignorance. it's just lack of knowledge. I get asked if I have to take T forever, often.
@desjardins I don't use it, but I don't see why that's such a nope. To each their own.
@moriahpariah Hahaha I warned you!
@moriahpariah no moving!
Drastic improvement since I filed a complaint on this urgent care. Even with that first comment. Doc was nice, used the right name. solid.
@hcatlin have fun!!
Triage nurse was much better. Friendly and used the correct name. Asked professional and appropriate questions.
At urgent care: \"you don't strike me as a 'birthname'.\"
Surge! https://t.co/GoGdOtOecy
Don't mind me.. Just taking up your pillows and spot in bed. I'm too cute to move, and you know it. https://t.co/h75njpWwNk
I've got the blues. not sleeping well or much, not very hungry, and feeling like my art isn't where I https://t.co/3Sc0rSbX4N
@transasaurusrex thanks!
Figuring out a good desktop organization is HARD, folks. iMac, 24\" monitor, laptop, scanner, AND still need space to draw.
@desjardins Don't do it! Don't feed the trolls!
Friendly reminder with #IAmCait out: don't read the comments. Take self care, you fabulous humans.
@SnugglePolish Haha fair enough! I'm trying out The Tomorrow People.
@snugglepolish The show from the 90's?
http://t.co/HM50wadYcf How privileged are you?
@quirkyrican I'm impressed too. I was skeptical, but it looks like it's going to be a positive thing.
@desjardins It is hard, but you can do it when the time is right. Trust your gut.
@moriahpariah I will be your companion.
@glaad @caitlyn_jenner @TVGuide needs a little help with using the correct name on their website.
@mashlifestyle @deliciouslydrew Great read!
Want to help out on a fun project, meet great folks, and stretch your linguistic muscle?! Come check out @thewordset! http://t.co/AFlmopME3O
@desjardins Listen to your gut. You can do this. Good luck!
@desjardins nope. not at all.
@desjardins here's the thing: he does know what I do, what I'm good at, and what I was getting paid.
@desjardins Graphic design and illustration. I just don't get where he thought that would be a good idea.
proof my dad doesn't know me at all: he emailed and said I should become a truck driver. as in 18-wheeler big truck driver. #shakeshead
I may have ordered a case of Surge. maybe. It was on sale.
@hcatlin That sucks. I understand though. That's why I have 2 accounts.
@moriahpariah because 'Merica.
@hcatlin Where?
@moriahpariah Might be worth watching. It's pretty terrible, but sci-fi.
@snugglepolish Thanks!
I'm trying out the Tomorrow People. @moriahpariah have you watched this?
@snugglepolish hahahaha
@rockstar_ @moriahpariah I sincerely hope I find a partner as awesome as you one day. And can be as happy as you both are. Ya'll are great.
@rogerderok being able to sleep in, for sure. And having some free time to relax and work on projects. Definitely not all bad.
@rogerderok With no job and no routine, my body is all, \"well, we're going to do wtf ever.\"
@rogerderok Yeah.. I can't sleep until I am absolutely exhausted. Going to sleep between 4-6am, waking up at 11am typically.
@moriahpariah I refuse to say anything. But we will have to talk about it. I need to discuss.
@moriahpariah you didn't know?! Yeah :-( It was cancelled last year.
@moriahpariah YEP!
@moriahpariah AND I LOVED IT. WHY DID IT GET CANCELLED?!
@moriahpariah Way ahead of you. I already finished it yesterday.
@rogerderok Haha. I'll still be up till 4 or 5 most likely, with how my sleeping has been.
My body is all, \"you want sleep? hahah NOPE!\" So I'll just be productive and order chinese food.
@desjardins I do.
@desjardins I don't know
And of course, this gem of perfection. @meredithlilsky is the best. http://t.co/EM3XL7C2Yd
new addition. a gentle reminder to keep going. http://t.co/11vifJOPtn
My semi colon tattoo is the perfect addition to remind me to never give up. \"Butter Me Up\" is perfectly perfect. But now I am so exhausted.
@desjardins Not the first time for me either. You think that's bad; don't go on grindr or scruff.
@hcatlin whoa. I didn't even know that happened.
@desjardins This makes me enraged. very enraged.
@desjardins congrats!
outline is done! http://t.co/YLUnRijlpK
Both cats are laying on me while I work. Both requiring that I'm at least touching them. It's adorable.
I got sucked into the Witches of East End. I'm a little bummed that it was cancelled. It's so bad and so good.
@desjardins I would correct her.
@desjardins depends on the situation. If it's somewhere or someone I would see again, yes.
@desjardins My dad doesn't bring it up either. Isn't the best. My mom is definitely better.
@desjardins My dad cosigned on my new car, but otherwise I'm independent. Still get lectures. Like what I shouldn't post on my own Facebook.
@desjardins my own parents tried to say that. as did the first therapist they had me go to.
@desjardins Have you explained that?
@desjardins @snugglepolish Does she have previous experience with trans identified patients?
@desjardins @snugglepolish I think a valid therapist with experience in the LGBTQ community is someone who can understand.
@desjardins that's good. Just keep it as an option. T brings a lot of emotions and changes. Good ones. I found it helpful to keep going.
@desjardins @snugglepolish I recommend therapy highly. I think it was helpful especially for the first few months and with my family.
@desjardins @snugglepolish In my experience, no.
@snugglepolish thanks!
creative types: I'm looking into a wacom tablet. Do they do palm rejection? Would medium be big enough?
the cats are napping in the sun, and it's warming my cold, dead heart.
@rockstar_ I will probably get a monitor as well.
@rockstar_ any reason?
@rockstar_ debating the new 15\" mbp.
@rockstar_ and Boba Fett (small one), and the Empire symbol (small too). Embracing my storm trooper car.
@rockstar_ i AM getting a giant storm trooper helmet sticker for the back.
Dear twitter, should I buy a decal that says \"No one cares about your stick figure family\" with an AT-AT shooting at them?
@moriahpariah I'm not getting married ever. But I will happily bake you a cake any time. After derby is over.
@moriahpariah I also need these tips. badly.
new car has a back up camera. I can get behind this. :D I crack myself up. sometimes. alone. at night.
Fry approves of our new ride. He demands pizza now. https://t.co/tWG0cWJqSt
@RogerDeRok last car was a 2012 Impreza wagon. Good cars just hate white.
@rockstar_ hush! :-P
Mindset: it'll be the storm trooper car. Subaru Impreza sedan.
So far, my dad has called me the wrong name 3 times. The wrong pronouns twice. Rolled his eyes when my mom corrected him.
Fry is my copilot on today's adventure https://t.co/vY8sN5zMoj
@moriahpariah the icons.
Those things will probably be related. As is the emotional exhaustion that is family.
Driving up to see the folks tomorrow in Glenwood Springs. Might come back with a new car, since my lease is up. Might also cry driving home.
@moriahpariah you were definitely right about pen tool in illustrator. So right.
@desjardins of course not. It's media. I just turned it on.
@desjardins that is what I mean. Considering a lot of the contestants fit into cis white male with privilege role. Who abuse that or deny it
@desjardins in the derogatory sense?
@desjardins is he a bro?
@desjardins You can't post on web.
They're rebooting #Xena. Lesbians my age everywhere are rejoicing around the world. This queermo is!
@desjardins pain should never be a deterring factor in tattoos. I have some on my chest and still plan on getting a bigger piece there.
@desjardins A lot more.
Uh. Seriously? Don't give away your used sex toys on Facebook. Just don't. No matter how sterile or clean you make them, they are used.
Roommates made cookie cats! #stevenuniverse https://t.co/OflROEnIRi
I SLEPT! OMG. I slept for almost12 solid blissful hours. I feel like a human again.
Carpel tunnel sucks. La Croix passionfruit does not. That is all.
@desjardins Haha I haven't noticed that before.
@desjardins Yeah. I noticed that too.
@desjardins @Z303 @leahvelcro @SnugglePolish will do. I started right before 30.
@desjardins @Z303 @leahvelcro @SnugglePolish will do. I started right before 30.
@desjardins you don't need a court order here for DL. Name changes are a pain.
@desjardins it's like that here too.
I just remembered a weird dream I had this morning about @YukariShinohara and they were showing me their collection of cute bento boxes.
@thewordset @sabreuse SO proud. not do. I'm sleep drunk.
I am do proud of our @thewordset community! The Gender Neutral Project was knocked out!
Working on fun things. https://t.co/9dBGAEf9AR
@desjardins @snugglepolish Hugs all around. I also have experience in that.
@kateleth my roommate just told me I should watch Steven Universe!
going to draw something for @moriahpariah to make up for being a last minute flake. I heart you! anxiety and hermit/work mode just wins.
@moriahpariah I will for sure. Having breakfast and then trying to nap.
@moriahpariah good morning sunshine. I was super productive during the night. But I can't fall asleep. Restless legs.
Sneak peak of the icons I've been working on for @thewordset http://t.co/t3knREChn3
Got all my sketches done! I feel exceptionally proud after the day I had.
Dear Apple Music, why N'Sync's \"Bye Bye Bye\" on this EDM Radio station??
@moriahpariah why what's up??
Just a reminder though: never read the comments. It will only infuriate and sadden.
I'm impressed. @Caitlyn_Jenner was stunning and gave a great speech. I applaud her for including some important issues in the community it.
@tcita hahaha yes!
@kalliewinners I can understand that and where you're coming from. But it's a broad generalization. I think that many do feel it.
feeling like the sketches I'm doing aren't up to what I want them to be. Taking a step back for a bit.
@kalliewinners I don't. I almost feel like the DP is an easy way out. Should have to live with the guilt and shame.
I'm not unhappy at the verdict. I am just not a supporter of the death penalty.
The #TheaterShooting verdict was Guilty of 1st degree murder. Over 100 counts. Sadly, most of the public wants the death penalty.
@ediecarey Congratulations!!
90 minute webinar on job searching. Presenter used my birth name even though I explained over the phone that I go by Zeller.
@transasaurusrex sometimes I'm lazy.
shot #70! 1 year, 5 months on #testosterone. fabulous as ever. https://t.co/uvIp1bee99
let it be known, that my love of Kate Winslet has not waned in 17 years. She is such a brilliant actress.
@desjardins @snugglepolish T = extra stinky, so that's mostly why I trim mine.
@desjardins @snugglepolish I know this was in jest, but my immediate reaction was cringe to this. Gender stereotypes suck.
@desjardins @snugglepolish I keep mine trimmed, or I would! I like the dyed beard look.
@SnugglePolish @desjardins It could be stuff recorded before the vanity cover. or she may have requested to use he pronouns for before that
@desjardins I don't think a trans teenager is very likely to be watching the espy's.
@desjardins I'm kind of over Caitlyn's fame stuff. also not at home right now.
@desjardins ooooh yeah. I saw that one a few weeks ago. it's good.
@desjardins I have no idea what you're talking about.
@hcatlin oh silly Hampton.
@hcatlin dear sweet jesus this is terrifying.
@desjardins @theadvocatemag #notsurprised transmen and TPOC often get left out. Advocate needs to check their privilege.
Applied for a job that would potentially work well, AND give me the opportunity to be in SF for a bit. Now forcing myself to go to bed.
@SnugglePolish @desjardins minor annoyance though in the grand scheme of things.
Can't remember the last time I had cereal. I'm having a big bowl of apple Jacks because adulting is hard.
@SnugglePolish awesome!!!
@desjardins @SnugglePolish this is true.
@SnugglePolish @desjardins it's just interesting. I feel like there's this big \"can a woman do it?\" feel. But I love the show too much.
@desjardins Yeah. Jessie.
Watching #ANW and #JessieGraff is my hero. Get it, girl.
@desjardins this girl is my hero.
@desjardins @SnugglePolish I do! But that comment about falling and hitting his nuts. \"Hell be feeling that tmrw. He at least has 1 kid\"
@SnugglePolish @desjardins YESSSSS. I'm watching!
@rockstar_ I forgot to eat today until about 3pm. Started listening to an audiobook, and bought running shoes. That's a start, right?
@desjardins @snugglepolish What channel?! I want to be in on this fun times!
Suicide Squad looks so good!
Yessss!!!! http://t.co/pey8g3lRca
This cat tho. Slowly warming my cold, dead heart. https://t.co/rMEDuQc5u9
Now I have a sketching desk and a computing desk. This little creative cave is taking shape.
@hcatlin I want one. I recommend it based in my also wanting one and friends who love theirs.
Nature is fascinating. #nofilter https://t.co/cNOMvv3tQK
I just woke up. It's already 3pm. Oops.
This is what insomnia and drinking coffee too late looks like. The sun is up and I'm still trying to https://t.co/CAWR9FKo4x
Reminder: chocolate covered espresso beans in a blended coffee drink are incredibly delicious, but will prevent my favorite thing: sleep.
@moriahpariah oooh I like that desk
The Twitter gestures in #iOS9 are weird. swiping up to get to the top makes my control center pop up 75% of the time.
@hcatlin downside for me: ingress doesn't work at all.
also, dear growlr kid, arguing with me other the proper usage of 'touch' is not winning you any points. now I'm just irritated.
ios9 doesn't want to let me scroll to the top on Twitter. lamesauce.
@moriahpariah EVERYTHING.
My last act at work was this blog post. All photos were taken by me. http://t.co/CGuBx7Yscq
@SnugglePolish I have an imac. It's a 2009. But I would like the portability. My current mbp is 9 years old.
@SnugglePolish I'm still debating if I can swing it. I just got laid off, but In the long run it would be worth it.
@desjardins @SnugglePolish you can have my uterus. Then it'll be a full set!
I slept through most of today. I don't really have regrets about that either. I only regret letting my coffee get cold.
@SnugglePolish thanks!
@moriahpariah YASSSSS!!!!
This is my life. Cat sleeping on my side. Cat sleeping behind me. The cuddles outweigh the need for https://t.co/CFeQJHkgps
@moriahpariah @rockstar_ hahahaha
@rockstar_ oooh! I do like the swimming level waltz.
@rockstar_ which level?
@hcatlin thanks!
Making a 9 year old MacBook Pro work again is a fun and sad adventure. positivity will resume tomorrow. today I'm letting myself be sad.
@the_clean_freak gross!
I need a hug. I want to drink but I'm not going to. I'm going to a meeting tomorrow. I got a lecture from parents that made me feel worse.
@desjardins yep. you're probably reading it right.
Well, that's not how I expected my day to go.
@sarrhansen why is there a bad in your freezer? And can I have it?
I need to sleep. The one night where I need to be extra rested, my anxiety decides otherwise. Hoping tomorrow doesn't bring bad news.
I am no longer being nice to creeps on scruff or grindr. Will now start using http://t.co/4SaWTQNoZg if necessary. Fuck all that.
@desjardins those aren't mom jorts.
@nananaJENNA it was pretty delicious.
I made carrot apple ginger juice because my body demanded something healthy. now it's a little perplexed.
@moriahpariah that she is. nicely done.
@rockstar_ I refuse to believe this.
@moriahpariah she's got a creepy vibe going on
@moriahpariah I like them, minus the conehead.
There's a spider in my car and I lost track of where it disappeared to. I loathe spiders. Anything creepy crawly. NOPE.
I had a nightmare where I accidentally drank wine. Like I forgot that I wasn't supposed to. I was pissed that I had to start all over.
@karimarie_ my stats http://t.co/UJwDEVqErx
@rockstar_ NO. Not allowed. I mean, it's a great place.
@nananajenna uh oh.
@rockstar_ Yes. What's up?
@desjardins much less feelings.
@karimarie_ for sure. If you decide to switch, there are good folks down there too. ;-)
It's pretty passive aggressive. AND he left packing foam out for my cats to \"play with\". AKA EAT. Not thrilled at that.
I think my roommate is waiting for me to empty the dishwasher - dishes pilled on the counter. But it's 98% his. I don't cook much at home.
@karimarie_ the resistance up here are super unfriendly, disorganized, and elitist. I went with the friendlier side, who have been awesome.
Oh hey there, I. Scream. I do enjoy you a lot. http://t.co/gcz66XxsMN
@karimarie_ Hahah yeah I also switched to Enlightened. So I had to start all over too after we talked.
Saw someone post a \"Straight Pride\" image to Facebook. NO. JUST NO.
Despite carpel tunnel sucking ass, I can get behind this rad drawing I did tonight. https://t.co/MAtYsKd52N
@kalliewinners What happened?
did I miss a message about the apocalypse? there's a line 6 cars deep for the gas station by my house.
I work for a company that refuses to openly support the gay marriage ruling. This saddens me greatly.
@kalliewinners Why thank you!
@rockstar_ I still consider it a particular style.
@rockstar_ hahaha I don't think so. But I also feel like it keeps giving me bands I DO NOT LIKE.
@rockstar_ haha I would appreciate Indie, EDM, and GTFO buttons.
@rockstar_ This list is pretty incomplete.
Insurance sucks. I have to submit an appeal explaining why I should have my surgery covered. I'm tired of fighting just to be myself.
I actually did my hair today. weird. http://t.co/o7dtAZXtut
@hcatlin those socks! adorable. all of it.
sent off my portfolio. now I commence stressing out or trying not to, and know that if it's meant to be, it will be.
portfolios are stressful but worth it. I feel like my work is never as good as I want it to be.
Happy National #CameraDay! This photo nerd celebrates Camera day every day! http://t.co/8JViVqRSuu
@desjardins Pretty sure HR would have a fit about that, too.
Dear grindr and scruff guys, asking what's in my pants before even saying hello, is just rude. Google 'transman' if you are that unaware.
@moriahpariah lies!
@rockstar_ I just took clippers to them. If nothing else, they feel amazing.
I shaved my legs, bc I can. Also bc I had a weird hairless patch from tattoo night. I felt demasculinized while doing it because patriarchy.
@moriahpariah and pepperoni! And ranch cheezits dipped in cream cheese.
@moriahpariah I had stuffed crust pizza. And it was so worth it.
this may not mean much to some, and it may seem silly to others, but I am pretty damn proud of myself https://t.co/DfvPPt9c3g
I bought all the beverages today. and a frozen pizza. I'm bad at adulting, but good at being hydrated? http://t.co/qwQ6fPqK3G
Leia's new name should be Destroyer. She now likes to flip the water bowl over, the food bowl, and just sit next to it in pride.
@desjardins @SnugglePolish @leahvelcro I did not. I hope it'll be available online.
Um. Why am I getting \"Senior Soulmates\" spam now? I'm only 30!

watching Boy Meets Girl and having all the feels.
Lately, I've been missing my old vocal range when singing. As a trained singer, it was a one of the reasons I waited so long to transition.
@yukarishinohara me too!
@rockstar_ nope.
@yukarishinohara It was so strange, but pretty awesome to hang out with him in my dream!
@rockstar_ I'm just tired of hearing it. Over and over. Every day.
@rockstar_ Well, apparently there was coding involved and the app was built, but Australian regulations on storing CC info was harsh?
I had a dream that Leonard Nimoy and I trimmed a hedge in the shape of Spock's face. He kept dropping his tools, so I kept picking them up.
@rockstar_ attempted to make the app but for all restaurants in her town.
@desjardins I use my profesh account for marketing and social media related stuff, since that's what I do for work.
This morning was the fourth time my boss tried to tell me about an app she made that is exactly like Starbucks' new order option. fourth.
@desjardins neither. I am Ron Swanson.
@moriahpariah gross.
Legitimately debating buying a box of Polaroid Type 55 expired film. But it's $60+ a box on eBay.
Another transwoman was murdered, making it the 9th confirmed this year. THIS IS NOT OKAY.
Lobster Roll food truck is at work today. I know what I'm having!
@adambeaugh not air conditioned at all. We have one of those suits for work. It's pretty terrible.
@framingdoors also, I want a daddy.
@framingdoors If I find out, I'll let you know. I'm the same way, boo.
@framingdoors haha danger, will robinson. I distinctly remember you texting me something about this.
@framingdoors dangerous.
@moriahpariah spoons?
@rockstar_ no. don't do it. maybe a blanket, picnic it up. but a mattress and sheets?
apparently bringing an inflatable mattress and umbrella is a thing to do at Edora Park. complete with sheets.
@harbingercoffee I totally agree. Cut wise, solid job. It was at Floyd's too. The beard trim is growing on me, if only bc it shapes my face.
The sun is coming up. I haven't gone to bed yet. Only because #insomnia sucks a lot. I've been exhausted, and have to be up in 4 hours.
I can't sleep, so ya'll get a little comparison. These have all been from the last 5ish years, and https://t.co/drPIB91UsT

I am speechless. this is fucking awesome. thank you @elisawikey! http://t.co/TZX1AZhmnv
I got a hair cut. Guy asked of he could clean up my beard. I didn't know he was going to give me a chin strap. Now I look like a douche bro.
@rockstar_ aww boo!
To those who've followed me in the last week, I'd love to know how you found me! Say hello!
@rockstar_ That is amazing! Have you seen the State Bicycle donut jersey?

@saralaakso this is true! next week bff lunch?
@saralaakso yeah.. I don't see St. Augustine as a college town either. I'm surprised about Austin as well. And a bit about Savannah.

@saralaakso @moriahpariah I'm talking about you both, silly.
@saralaakso it is. who doesn't love old Spanish castles and the fountain of youth?!
@saralaakso This is very true. I am pretty partial to being near my bffs @moriahpariah
@saralaakso I've lived in the top 3!
@desjardins are you stalking me? I was just reading it as you tweeted.
@moriahpariah I want to do that. I need sleep.
@KayStroik I was pretty ashamed of it. I'm glad too though.
EMT boy I went on a coffee date with drunk texted me last night. Saying he was black out drunk. NOPE. NOPE. NOPE.
@transasaurusrex OITNB and Sense8 took over my life most recently.
@transasaurusrex I haven't in a while, but I did binge the first 2-3 seasons.
I found out Hawaii doesn't have snakes. I want to move there even more now.
if I go, I want to wear a leather bulldog harness and be proud of my transition. also, I'm chubby and self conscious. so, maybe next year.
debating pride weekend. typically it's been a weekend of drunken dancing. last yr, my EMT friend gave me fluids to help sober up. #notproud
@desjardins I'm glad!
@desjardins there are plenty of men who aren't into sports.
@desjardins just kidding. Coming Down by Dum Dum Girls.
@desjardins Hugs Can be Deceiving?
it's hard sometimes to work in the environment I do. it's so booze focused when its stressful. everyone is aching to drink after a tough day
Randomly met 3 other people walking around, playing #ingress on my lunch. One graciously helped me level.
@rockstar_ I used to have my code memorized. I'll find it tonight for you.
@rockstar_ I have a 3DS.
@rockstar_ Hi friend. I will always be down to play Nintendo games.
@spacemonaut fact.
I responded that my non-theist group would say otherwise. #sober doesn't have to mean spiritual awakening. It can also mean self aware.
2 weeks sober. Going to the LGBT meeting on Wednesday. Feeling good. I was told today that being an atheist doesn't work in AA. Judge much?
@moriahpariah subtle, no?
@desjardins awww. Thanks! He's not the brightest, but he's cuddly and very cute. Was born with half a tail, and meows at life all the time.
Albus is a bit loopy from the medicine he's on, but he's finally cuddling me again. http://t.co/qmD0rfrzNN
Books I got this weekend: Sharp Objects, Haunted, #makesomethingup. Can't wait to devour them all.
@moriahpariah yes. Art supplies. always.
@quirkyrican @sarrhansen Can attest to brussels sprouts and their amazingness.
I'm like an overly protective parent right now. I baby Albus, give him extra cuddles, and don't make him move when I'm uncomfortable.
@tanida12 #GoT
Denver has movie theaters with lazy boys! Wtf? http://t.co/CkOeR2ZtdK
@snugglepolish haha yes! I love it. They are also in my top 5 faves.
@snugglepolish Definitely! I recommend it. It's nothing fancy, just solidly good sandwiches.
@rockstar_ I could see that, with the location requirements, like how Google Maps drains my battery. It looks fun. I'm going to try it out.
@snugglepolish And their cherry limeade is delightful.
@snugglepolish I usually get all the toppings. Some subs don't require the choice. Their meatball sub is good too.
@snugglepolish I love them all, but my top 2 faves are the Hook and Ladder or NY Steamer. I like them bc they're steamed/hot subs.
I went to my first #AA meeting tonight. Chose the right one, considering it was non-theist.
@SnugglePolish I don't think so. Not sure what's up. But it does keep happening.

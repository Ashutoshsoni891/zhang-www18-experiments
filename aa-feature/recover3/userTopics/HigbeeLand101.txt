Week 1 sober: I am so angry at everyone &amp; everything. I feel like I'm finally realizing that most people are full of shit... #IsThisNormal
Went to my 1st AA meeting tonight... I was completely terrified, but the group welcomed me with open arms! Got my 1st coin too! #Serenity
Day two sober... I don't feel myself. I'm in a haze. Going to my first AA meeting tonight. #sobriety #onedayatatime #soberliving #Iamscared
Day one sober... And my friends start giving the cold shoulder. Real friends shouldn't do that. #Truth

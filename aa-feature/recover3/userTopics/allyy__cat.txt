Last tweet for a year! Wishing all of you a happy new year and may 2017 be a better year for us all.
Last night in Sonoma county! Momma's making burgers tonight
#mondaymotivation Just feeling so fucking grateful. Got into the program I wanted. I anxiously await my new beginnings. &lt;3
Cheers to new beginnings!!!
This is what I've needed all along, for a very long time.
Tomorrow at 2 pm. I'm excited.
PRAYERS ANSWERED AND WHAT A RELIEF: open bed at Via Avanta in Pacoima for me!! I'm going to use as much social media as I can before
@LiveSober80 Me too :(
@cassieglows @soberboots @surelybutslowly Thanks!!!!
@KEvans11072010 Thank you so much for all your the tips!
@Jay3AA Thank you!!
@SherriRheaume Thank you!
@KEvans11072010 Yeah!! That's what happens to me!!
@KEvans11072010 I'll definitely try it :)))
@KEvans11072010 Oh wow! No I haven't! But thank you

And I'm trying the Sleepytime tea tonight and the English Breakfast Tea in the morning just for a switch up of coffee.
I've become quite the tea drinker as of late. I love the Well Rested chamomile and mint tea, the Autumn Apple Rooibos Tea from TJ's
@KEvans11072010 Thank you for these words. &lt;3 It means a lot to have support on here
@FrankvanNie @knuf1985 Of course. &lt;3
Wtf. And he is making the most pitiful sounds
My dog will not stop begging and whining. This is only exacerbating my irritability. He was already fed. Just took him out so he could pee.
@FrankvanNie @knuf1985 A mixed episode is when someone experiences manic and depression symptoms with bipolar
New post! https://t.co/CkjvBBP5Ah
@knuf1985 @FrankvanNie For me, it can be a signal that I'm headed into a mixed episode. But I'm not sure this time. It sucks.
@markmellorjones Thank you so much. xx
Writing a blog post :D
Thank you everyone, this is why I love my #TwitterFamily
I don't need to hide under an alias anymore and it feels so freeing.
and by the way, Ciara Marie was my alias. My real name is Simone Jane Brodey.
@soberboots Thank you Damien.  I really needed to hear that
@hdbigjourney @KEvans11072010 Thank you both  it's just hard to experience
Felt like this last night too. Gonna try to go back to bed and see if that helps
It feels like I'm here, but I'm not "here". It's so odd.
It just feels like everything is clouded and foggy. I feel disoriented and have trouble following conversations or engaging in them.
Im in a really weird mental state right now. I can't even explain in words. It's not sadness, anxiety, hypomania, or numbness.
@AmbAdAstra Pretty much my life. My birth mom always did that shit to me
@Crymsen_Skye Feeling the same way. :(
@danielhortonseo Me too :/
@AmbAdAstra Yep, it will be! A dinner out with my parents, what could be better? :D
Also a gorgeous picture. The sun hitting the tree in the front yard. &lt;3 #nature #fallfavorites #colorful https://t.co/2DXXV58otY
Spritzed a few drops of her In Love Again perfume. It smells warm and comforting; and a woman who loves herself. #PositiveVibes
First time in MONTHS wearing make up! But I only did it subtly. A little goes a long way. I'm wearing my new cute clothes my mom got me &lt;3
@markmellorjones I know! This was taken at a little past sunrise. Too good of an opportunity to miss!
From this morning.  https://t.co/F3nsJrPi2O
Started my morning with an amazing walk into Annadel State Park. 37 degrees, but worth it!
@mymameisrichard Thank you very much. Xoxo
Better days are here.
@mymameisrichard Thank you!! I appreciate the support
@Bobby_Steps Thank you! I did go today and I'm going to one tomorrow too
Anxious as fuck right now. I hate this shit.
Thank you everyone for all your support!!!  so much gratitude to express
Hit 30 days sober from alcohol today!! So proud of myself
Good morning everyone!
@mechanical_meat Thanks!! I did
Bed time. Good night all
710 followers!?!? I love you guys!!! So much.
And finally got my hair cut evenly with some layers haha. I definitely fucked up my hair back in September when I was hypomanic
About to have halibut, baby potatoes, and asparagus for dinner. Cannot wait.
Sipping on some hot tea, ate some cookies, and I'm just chillin.
Animals are great
Been around Biscuit so long and being around Lizzie's fur babies, I'm so used to doggies now :)
I think Cosmo (my step mom's dog) has arthritis. He is 14 years old after all. Starting to move like me. Poor baby :(
42 degrees. Thank god for warm and fuzzy blankets!
@fluffybipolar Me too!
@Crymsen_Skye
Supposed to get real chilly tonight
Finally made it! Feels good
@OliviaKMaynard So sorry love! :(
@Crymsen_Skye I'm so sorry. :( you're in my thoughts
@Crymsen_Skye I could go for a smoke too right now
@Crymsen_Skye you okay???
Forgot how bad the traffic is until 4 lanes narrow down to 2..
@Crystalielie Exactly!!!
@Crystalielie and it's always so embarrassing standing outside a public bathroom doing the 2 step like a toddler
@Crystalielie yeah it's a bummer :/
@AmbAdAstra I bet!! Like, I feel like my dad who needs to use the bathroom all the time. I seriously feel your pain!
One sip of water and I need to pee
Damn this fucking hydrochlorothiazide. It's a new medicine to lower my BP but it's also a diuretic.
Why are baby animals so cute!?!
Just saw baby calfs. Omg.
@LucyLu_Life Sending love your way!!
Can't wait to see what meetings are in Santa Rosa!
Just did some writing on the train. It was awesome.
Met a family on their way to San Francisco. Beautiful family. This is what life is about, talking to people, and being comfortable with you.
#MyMorningRoutineIncludes breakfast, coffee, Third Step prayer, meditation, and journaling.
Even while traveling, I can still meditate and work the steps. Did a 4th step and meditated for 20 minutes. #XA #RecoveryPosse
@25Years1Lesson Thank you!!
Wish I could say the same thing with my binging/compulsive overeating, but I have no idea where to even start.
As of June 22nd, I haven't purged for 5 months. #edrecovery #ednos #bulimia
27 days. So grateful and blessed. December 1st will be 30 days!!! #XA #addictionrecovery
Going to the Bay Area for a week to visit my dad and step mom tomorrow! :D
Got packing to do, a train ticket to book, phone calls to make, and self care to do. #mondaymotivation
The most painful memories are when Facebook shows you on this day and you're reminded of when life was pretty good.
So tired...
Wtf this phone needs charging again....
Can't wake up cause I dream all night.. Puddle of Mudd
I'm not having cravings tonight. What a relief. But I am getting my ass to a meeting tomorrow.
@accordingtokenz It rained here so my whole body hurt and all I did was stay in bed till 5 pm.
@accordingtokenz Me too, as a person who gets migraines three times a month and has fibro.
@AmbAdAstra @empty__space__ Feeling the same way. :( but I'm just trying to stay busy
@knuf1985 Me too, probably
And people talking about weight loss and health. My weight is my last problem. Focusing on my sobriety is a challenge on its own.
Diet talk two days after thanksgiving. Almost left the room. Talking about shit I did not need to hear. #mentalhealth #eatingdisorders
Feeling so sad and low today. :(
Well, never went. Ugh. Cannot make up my mind today on anything.
Off to a meeting in Silver Lake
25 days!!!
Thank you so much everyone!!
And ended up in the emergency room again. Migraine this time..just left.
Thanks everyone for all the support! Means a lot!!!
Fucking hell, of course a pigeon took a giant shit on my shirt. I don't have an extra one so I'm wearing a tank top in 58 degree weather
@soberboots Thanks Damien, you're awesome!
@LiveSober80 Thanks honey! xx
@birdieartie @Bobby_Steps Thank you guys so much!!!
Even though it's 55 degrees, I wear a sweater but will still drink iced cold brew.
@surelybutslowly hi!!
@surelybutslowly Thank you so much!
I never in my life thought I was an addict to anything besides the bottle. But I've come to terms with a lot of things
And I'm 1 year clean from opiates as of 10/27/15.
Hi, my name is Ciara and I'm an alcoholic/addict. Today, I'm 24 days sober from alcohol. As of 01/182014, I'm 2 years clean from pot.
Paradise.  https://t.co/4rQJMvXoBt
Thank you!!! https://t.co/9NdmDS2cXp
@BipolarHeaded Thank you for this.
Be kind to yourselves guys. #Mentalhealth #eatingdisorders #substanceabuse #holidayscanbehard
As I was unable to get to a meeting today, my walk on the beach was my meeting. #XA #addiction #alcoholism
Now just hanging out with Biscuit and meeting some new fur babies. Listening to the waves crash on the rocks
Went on an amazing walk on the beach earlier.
For those of you in LA County the number is 323-936-4343. In the SF Valley, their number is 818-988-3001.
And for my fellow sober brothers and sisters, call your central office and see what thanksgivings you can go to!
And for those who don't have places to go on thanksgiving, I'm here to talk to. xx
And my doggie gets to run around on the beach
Spending it in Malibu at my family friend's beach house.  should be fun
Happy Thanksgiving!!!
@SherriRheaume Thank you for this! I needed to hear it
@BiggieSmalley Very true.  thank you
I wish I wasn't so sensitive to people just telling me things
I cannot make more mistakes today and pray that I don't
I cannot be criticized for anything else or I'll fold
Now feeling like a hot mess again.
But on the other hand, I have 22 days of sobriety!! #XA #recoveryroad
I feel like a hot mess this morning. So nervous.
@Wayward_LDS Thank you so much
and when I'm hypomanic I feel amazing
I just want to feel good
I want to go off my meds so bad
I hope a depressive episode isn't on the way...I've been without my Abilify for a few days and haven't taken my Lamictal for a few days.
I hate feeling so sad. Fuck.
Love coffee chats with friends
Praying for him instead of being angry at him.
Got told to hurry up by someone in line at Starbucks. Didn't take it personally. He's either in a hurry or having a bad morning.
Can't sleep so why not get to an early meeting?
@surelybutslowly @birdieartie Exactly! Thank you so much
@birdieartie Thank you for the tips!
@BiggieSmalley Aw that's cute!!
@xxloopixx hi my dear! xx
@bipolar4good good night. And good morning to you :)))
@soberboots Thank you! This is why I love you guys
Good night everybody.
@soberboots But I will for sure have my phone handy!
@soberboots Cause the actual day of Thanksgiving I won't be able to go to meetings that day..
@soberboots Yeah, I'm worried about it. Gotta make sure to go to a lot of meetings before Wednesday and thanksgiving day
@25Years1Lesson I don't think so :( Already have 20 people coming
@VanRyan Thank you, love! xx
He was checking to make sure I was okay. &lt;3 animals are great that way!
My dog is seriously the best. I said "ow" because my tea was really hot while I was putting it down and he came over to the table.
@RDW2303 Thanks, you as well!
@RDW2303 Ohh! Pardon my mistake  congrats on 14 months!!!
@bipolar4good Thank you!
@ELECTR0N1TE I'll DM you
That and the holiday season is tough for many people. Not just me.
Really stressed about Thanksgiving..eating disorder wise and sobriety wise. No wonder I've been feeling so down lately.
@bipolar4good Of course love! xxx
@RDW2303 So very sorry you're going through this. Relapse is so difficult. I've relapsed so many times. I have 19 days clean youre not alone
Feeling much better. I was like a cranky 2 year old who needed time out. =/
It was raining when I got home, so it was easy to focus my meditation on the rain. Then I took a nap since I got up super early.
I've done a total of 45 minutes of meditation. 30 minutes at my meeting this morning and 15 minutes at home.
@ELECTR0N1TE Thanks so much. Feeling kind of okay today
@abbie_grrl Yes. It will
@24bearcoughlan Yes! Thank you for that
@ELECTR0N1TE Thanks! Actually no, but I'm in a 12 Step program so that's the prayer we always use
@24bearcoughlan Thank you for your words.
@SarahQ1970 Thank you! xx
@ELECTR0N1TE Feeling the same way tonight :(
@24bearcoughlan I have a lot of times. I just feel very diminished at the moment
Definitely was overdue for anti anxiety meds, so that should help my anxiety some
What the fuck :(
I wish I didn't feel so sad tonight
I don't know what I'm doing anymore
There must be some kind of way out of here
@surelybutslowly Yeah :(
Been fighting eating disorders for 16 years. Five months and I haven't purged. #WeDoRecover
#WeDoRecover It works if you work it. #XA #addiction
When people use the words retarded or retard. As someone who has been called these names #ItAffectsMe #aspergers #ASD
18 days today.
@soberboots @yujachingu @surelybutslowly @Bobby_Steps Thank you everyone!
@yujachingu @surelybutslowly @soberboots @Bobby_Steps Exactly.
I love night meetings. They're kind of magical. :D
It helped me so much. Left a meeting in Koreatown because it wasn't a good meeting, but found a meeting in WeHo that was awesome!!
And yes, the feelings did pass. Went to a night meeting last night and it helped! @yujachingu @surelybutslowly @soberboots @Bobby_Steps
And yes, the feelings did pass. Went to a night meeting last night and it helped! @yujachingu @surelybutslowly @soberboots @Bobby_Steps
Thank you everyone for all your support!! It means so much to me to know I have people who are here for me. xx
@mechanical_meat Thank you. &lt;3
I honestly feel like crying.
I just want to be numb. And not feel anything.
I fucking hate this shit. The witching hour of anxiety and cravings and what not. Just made myself coffee as if that's gonna help..
@s_rlewis Yeah its awful :( sorry to hear the meds aren't helping. :( much love xx
Waiting and having nothing to do only drives me crazier, and it's a short drive. #sobriety #Anxiety #bipolar
@VivianJovanni Trying :/ thanks for the message!
@thecupcakegirl8 @ELECTR0N1TE @ScienceLover4 @SickNotWeak No please don't! I don't know you, but please DM me if you need to talk
@abbie_grrl So sorry :'(
@s_rlewis I'm in pain too. Fibro sucks ass. And I'm also having chest pain which hurts like hell. I can barely move
And got the day wrong for a 7:15 am meeting in Hollywood. Ugh. Got up before 6 am for nothing.
And of course I forget everything I need for my doctors appointment today :(
@abbie_grrl @soberboots Oh my :( sorry you went through that
@soberboots Thanks!
@soberboots Oh boy, it's scary isn't it?? I was freaked. :(
Very painful, but not dangerous.
With costochondritis, which is inflammation surrounding the cartilage of the breast bone and ribs.
Boy what a night last night. Ended up in ER for chest pain; a bunch of tests were run. Everything turned out normal, however was diagnosed
@LiveSober80 Thank you sweetie!! The support is so appreciated! Xxx
And dealing with resentments is never easy
On Fourth Step as we speak.
15 days. Great meeting. Awesome meeting with sponsor. Went from paralyzed by anxiety this morning to feeling good now.
@thecupcakegirl8 I'm sorry :(((
Went to my first night meeting last night! It was a cool experience :)
@RealismBites I so know the feeling. :(
@SarahQ1970 Trying :/ doing my best.
So anxious I could literally jump out of my skin. I need to take up smoking again. Cigarettes, pot, something.
13 days! #ImNotAshamed #sobriety #recoveryroad
I think I've had enough buses for today
Finally home after a long ass day
Feeling kind of numb/stunned at the moment
@knuf1985 Oh wow :( I'm sorry that happens
All I can say is so far so good. Felt like shit last night here and there, but took a really long walk home. Walks are crucial for me
Have now found a better way to get to Santa Monica with the Expo Line
@ideationsuicide Yes indeed! #Selfcare it was :D
Feeling so rejuvenated and grateful. Met some amazing people today, and learned how to meditate for the first time!
I always know I can come out on the other side
Feeling much better. Thanks to Klonopin, an hour nap, a walk to the store, and burritos for dinner.
@NeedsNYC Thank you gorgeous!
Had a lovely talk with my sponsor today
@LiveSober80 Thank you honey!
@MoaningMomma Thank you so much!!
I could really use a drink :( 11 days sober. When does it get better?
Feeling so sad today :(
@thecupcakegirl8 Sorry :( me too
@hellobipolar Aw thank you!!
"There's no connection to myself. I'm your lover, I'm your zero."
"I'm not gonna lie, I'll not be your gentleman."
"I'm unimpressive motherfucker, wouldn't you say?"
No, I'm not sad. Just in a very triggered head space.
Fake it till you make it, they say. But I can't fake it anymore.
Keeping up the happy face gets tiring.
"She, she ain't real. She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will."
@24bearcoughlan Thank you so much. I needed to hear that. Xo
I could use a big hug right now.
I still feel so shitty.
I know I did the right thing for me by leaving the meeting. But my feelings are still sticking.
I don't need to know this stuff. First time I ever walked out on a meeting.
You wanna say shit like that, go to group therapy or support groups.
So triggered :(
Most Wonderful Time of the Year is playing..
#FlashbackFriday This time last week, I was in the psychiatric hospital. So happy to be out, safe, stable, and being well taken care of.
Thanks for the follow @BiggieSmalley
So proud of myself.
Boy did I have a day, a productive one though! And I was the leader of a meeting this morning!!!
Is it bed time yet?
Nine days!!! #XA #recoveryroad #blessed
But I'm ready to face the day
Had nightmares all night
Boy was it hard to get up this morning
Do I really wanna watch the news? Ugh
@mechanical_meat Either chicken tikka or chicken tikka masala. And lots of naan!
Indian food for dinner. #winning
@LiveSober80 Aw, thanks lovely!! Xxx
@mechanical_meat Thanks! Xx
Hopefully my Klonopin kicks in soon.
I just can't stop thinking about stuff. Ugh. Anxiety sucks.
Guess nap isn't happening. Oh well. Too anxious to sleep.
I hate waking up from naps, but I'm tired :(
I wanna take a nap, but I don't. :/
@LiveSober80 Thank you my love! Xx
@soberboots Thank you so much!! :D
Eight days sober, eight days strong. Went to an amazing meeting in Hollywood this morning. #XA #recoveryroad #grateful
@KellyLottsMM Thanks for the follow as well! Much appreciated. Xx
Off to bed. Xx
Just talked to my cousin, left messages for friends, and talked to an old college friend. We had the best talk.
@24bearcoughlan Aw, thank you!!! That means a lot!
But at least I took a 2 hour nap! That was nice :)
I'm also going to ask her about dissociation and what I can do about it.
Could I have PTSD or is it too soon to be diagnosed? I see my psychiatrist on Thursday.
And I didn't know I dissociate so much. That's scary.
Things that have happened over time. Especially recently. I have nightmares and flashbacks. I just took a online quiz on dissociation
Still feeling weird. Took a nap, but still feel weird. I had to commute to the Valley this afternoon and had flashbacks of
@Ihatethisugh1 Thanks so much, will try :)
@mechanical_meat Thank you! :)
Feeling much better. Took my first Klonopin in two days
Flashbacks..
Watching Law and Order: SVU because I can't find the food network. And can't sleep.
@mechanical_meat Thank you so much! Xx
@ideationsuicide Yes. Exactly! Hope you're doing okay
I feel very loved
I feel so not alone tonight. It's a good feeling
You're not alone
Finally back on twitter and out of the hospital. So grateful to have gotten the help
Went to an awesome meeting this morning #XA #recoveryroad
6 days.
@jmpreston114 So sorry for your loss
Off to first AA meeting in almost a month! Let's do this!

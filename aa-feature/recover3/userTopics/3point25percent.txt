Did my taxes. I owed WAY less than I thought. HUGE relief. Money left over after I pay out. New shoes are in order. Mines have holes.
Planning is underway for Vol2 Issue2. Looking to schedule interviews/photoshoots which is IMPOSSIBLE ..
I wanna see you again, but I'm stuck in colder weather. Maybe tomorrow will be better, can I call you then? #gypsysoul #bornforleavin

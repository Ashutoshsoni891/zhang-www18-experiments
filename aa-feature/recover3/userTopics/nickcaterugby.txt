@ManicPangloss courage is necessary for success
@ManicPangloss I'd argue that a lot of people in our generation are cowards
@ManicPangloss im not saying that its right im just saying that's what most people do nowadays
@ManicPangloss because its easier to fake a smile and pretend they don't care then risk failure trying to keep love alive
Rest day = stretching, binge eating healthy carbs, and lots of Battlefield 4
I can still feel your soul so regardless of the front you put up... Just know that I know.

\"@mattie_rogers: #unapologetic https://t.co/Pr25Eriz96\" Monday Motivation lads
Being nice to your parents goes suchhhh a long way. The little things really do mean a lot to them.
@evamh6 PREACH. But on that note.... If they were talking shit at any point, like ever, they don't deserve a shot regardless. Snakesssssssss
@whoisKate32 she copes by pushing me away. I cope by expressing my pain. Im going to be alright. Bitterness only breeds negativity
@whoisKate32 what
Like what's wrong with you people. Jus cus we'll never be together again and will end up w other people doesn't mean we weren't in love
I want people to know I love you. And if you aren't cool with that Im sorry tough shit I still love you and refuse to hide it
What I put on my body is for my own personal motivation and tells MY story. Dont try to tell me what I can or can't get tatted.
Like Im not going to just pretend I dont care and if I feel so strongly about something that I want a tattoo Im going to get a tattoo
I love how what Im doing to cope with what happened and deal with my own pain is somehow \"selfish and manipulative\"
Excuseeee me for being sentimental lol
If you surround yourself with driven, motivated, disciplined, like-minded individuals you will all be unstoppable.
@JamesHollandIII ay that meant a lot to me the other night. I know we had our differences at one point but I truly respect you as a leader
@flowwbott1 @JamesHollandIII Where two or three are gathered in My name, there I am in the midst of them.\rMatthew 18:20

Let the countdown begin... https://t.co/oDbu6by6t5
Love has the strength to move mountains
Granted, a painful one. But the final act hasn't even begun yet.
This is just an intermission.
Grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled, as to console; to be understood, as to understand; to be loved as to love.
My heart is somewhere in Atl
Day 11
Big first step tonight
When you hear Kevin Gates, I hope you think of me
@Brandon93Smith might be going to my first AA meeting tonight

Definitely in a sophomore slump
@molly_pippin @ShyannMae @brtburns42 lucky to have you guys. Love you all to the moon and back
Craving EBA's
@brtburns42 that wasn't much better, I tried
Never sleeping on the floor ever again
Maybe this'll be the third night I don't remember
@lexalestock thanks love! We'll definitely hang out next time you're up!
Looking forward to this weekend
Having to walk outside to do laundry is the most awful thing in the world
@ShyannMae for clinical rotations
5 am practice tomorrow. Already crying
@brtburns42
@molly_pippin what's going on? Text me
What the actual fuck just happened
I don't know what to feel anymore
My brother cries after he runs out of sweet &amp; sour sauce from McDonald's
Nick thinks I'm an alcoholic, but it's ok because he's decided to be supportive of my decisions
11:11
Another physics class cancelled
Everyone that knows me should know that I'm a fucking bitch in the morning
My teacher clearly hates physics as much as I do because he keeps cancelling class
Thank God for delays
Feels so good to be back on the court
Telling Kayley things she doesn't remember about our nights together  &gt;&gt;&gt;
Already looking forward to going to bed tonight
Happy  Wednesday
It's so cold out that it hurts to breath

Hungover shopping trips with mom are always interesting

Great, it finally snows and I don't have winter tires
 nights are the best nights

Praying that physics gets cancelled again
Ready to go home for the weekend
@abby_magnussen https://t.co/ratGBrwLhu
@abby_magnussen this is why you aren't allowed to do this. It's creepy!  https://t.co/ppikwix9ge
Finding out that physics got cancelled makes me the happiest person alive!
@aambernicole_ @SMACKHighCT it's me!
Keene's omelettes&gt;&gt;&gt;
Already looking forward to my nap today
I could get used to this lazy Sunday thing
"I find myself very eortically charged""Is that college talk for horny?"
Abby's life motto "I really have no idea what I'm doing"
@abbey_welch3 miss you more
Let's go here  @abby_magnussen  https://t.co/TpcBUmWlYw
I'm really not a morning person
Dr. Timmer ruins dreams
I love waking up to a cold shower because Keene won't fix the broken water heater
Not having to leave bed all day&gt;&gt;&gt;
Not drunk enough
@molly_pippin sounds better than the dreams you had in Mexico!
When the sizzler guy remembers your order
Don't even know what to think anymore
I need a back rub
I love hearing all about the dreams Molly has had while we've been in Mexico
If I go home without any color I'm gonna be pissed
@aambernicole_ I don't know why, but I just had a dream about you getting your passport. Ask your parents again!
@kayleygray13  https://t.co/42W3PDUBKl
@abby_magnussen I miss you
B? @abby_magnussen
I plan on being drunk this whole vacation
What could be better than beer in champagne glasses?
@Dvilla_18 I saw that
"Take your cat and leave my sweater"
Starting off 2016 by laying on a beach with my best friend. Cancun here we come
@abby_magnussen I said "in and around my mouth" tonight and my coworker judged me hard
"Shed toned"
@aambernicole_ I'll pick you up in like 4 hours haha
Someone bring me to Apple Bees. I want lava cake
Of course I didn't get your text dumbass, I blocked you from my life
I hate realistic dreams
Playing cards against humanity with my family is the best
@molly_pippin lets go here next  https://t.co/JuMcbAndN2
So ready to be in Mexico, 9 more days! @molly_pippin
Love getting daily snapchats from @molly_pippin at work
@Dvilla_18 I miss you. You're like the only guy that will rub my back and play with my hair without bitching about it
@aambernicole_ oh god, were on vacation! Stop worrying about it
@Dvilla_18 @aambernicole_ love you guys
Just in one of those moods
@abby_magnussen or this one?? https://t.co/1RR9bQWRno
@abby_magnussen can we please get it?!  https://t.co/8agwWjyjaI
It made my night to have people come into the store and sing Christmas carols
@abby_magnussen so this is how you do it  https://t.co/CIWct9mmGw
See you next semester KSC
Final final. Here we go!
So much for all that studying
All I need is a 55% to pass, I can do it
@abby_magnussen  https://t.co/oVzwTXWnr9
Well here goes everything
Praying I pass recognition
Only 4 finals, 3 days, and a lot of tears until winter break. I can do this
I'm really not good at this whole being quiet in the library thing
I look and feel like shit. Can't wait to see what the rest of the day brings
Why am I up right now?!
Going to bed before midnight&gt;&gt;&gt;
@molly_pippin  https://t.co/toNDLRwVx5
Watching the VS fashion show makes me want to go to the gym and lose 500 lbs
Love you @aambernicole_  https://t.co/ndlM8ydwQk
Just wanting to move somewhere where no one knows my name
Really want to watch a Cinderella story right now @brtburns42 @ShyannMae @molly_pippin

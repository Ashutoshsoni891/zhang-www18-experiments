I need Ambien tonight. Fuck me... I wish hubby was home to calm me down :'(
I'm so nervous. Super anxious to get the apps in like yesterday. Work tomorrow, then drive up to fire camp to get hubs signature. Then pray.
It's a cottage w/ a yard, middle of downtown, 6 blocks from my work, allows pets, within our budget, and 1000sq ft. #pleasepleasePLEASE!!
Might possibly have found a place. It is PERFECT. 4th in line currently but owner said that means nothing. Don't want to jinx it. #hope
I want to eat b/c I'm a fucking cow. Thinking steamed green beans. W/ Italian seasoning and a huge glass of water. Would that be okay? :(
Even worse, it's free w/ the Super Bacon Cheeseburger combo. Why don't you just inject 10lbs of fat into your body instead? #carlsjr
I keep seeing that Carl's Jr ad for the Poptart Ice Cream Sandwich. Fucking nasty. #carlsjr
Okay, have I officially made enough of an ass of myself? Can I die of embarrassment now?
So it's Sunday. Which means I won't see my husband again for 9 days AND I have to go back to work tomorrow. Suck.
Alright alright done whining right now. Going to go package up all those baked goodies before I have to take hubby back to fire camp.
The whole leaving AA thing has just made me think of that a lot lately. I feel like I'm dancing around relapse. Sigh. #fuckup
Ugh, typo. Too lazy to remove and retype.
It was over 3mos ago and I still have an intense fear of being left alone. I still wake up screaming. I'm still scared. Always scared.
What if I'd hit a vein when I destroyed my arms. What if I knocked myself out when convulsing on the floor. What if what if what if...
I still have nightmares about that night. What if I hadn't made it to a phone... What if instead of crawling I couldn't move at all...
I always felt that no one took my drug addiction/alcoholism seriously. So I made it worse. And worse. And worse. Until I almost died.
Sigh... I'm just a fucking pussy. I hate hearing, talking, thinking, remembering, reminiscing, anything about drugs. #trigger #addict
Every time I even hear the fucking name I get flashbacks. Crystal lines on my counter top, the burn, the drips, the insomnia, the craving...
Hi, can people please stop talking about Breaking Bad. I get it, good show, whatever, but it's triggering to some of us addicts. Kthxbai.
Yay! For the firefighters &lt;3 Didn't eat any, just licked the brownie spoon :P #firefighter #treats #yum http://t.co/2TagtOlCjJ
I get to have fun baking, get all this bake mix out of the house, and they get sweet treats for all their hard work. It's win/win/win! :D
Spent the last 3hrs baking my husband's firefighter crew a whole bunch of cookies and brownies :) Chugging water so as not to be tempted :)
Oh AND a huge bowl of yogurt hut AND Dutch Bros skinny white mocha AND sugary coffee!! Still lost.. But fuck I'm so gross!
Despite 3 double stuff oreos (I know, shame) &amp; going out to bfast (fruit w few bites of biscuits/gravy), I still lost... #WTF #progress?
lost 0.2 lbs since her last weigh-in! Warriorgirl2013's lost 15.4 lbs so far. #myfitnesspal
Night... http://t.co/U0jQGmEORP
The smoke is creeping in the window, smelling like fire and making me miss my husband even more... Why can't he be with me... #cry
Two Ambien. Two Melatonin. Now we play the waiting game. Usually doesn't take too long, fortunately.
My dog is scary intuitive. When I have no one, he's right there. He knows. He always knows. &lt;3 I love you Oakley. You're my baby.
Was looking at my arm scars noticing how they've healed when my dog randomly comes up &amp; licks them. It's like he knows. &amp; He's right there.
I wish I could just take the whole bottle and sleep until I'm skinny.
I'm just going to take a couple Ambien and go to bed so I stop distracting my husband. He needs to focus or it's dangerous.
The fat just hangs off my body like a tumor. A disease that infects me. Every time I eat, it feeds this disease. I'm killing myself slowly.
He's trying to make me feel better by telling me all these lies about how beautiful/sexy I am, but I know the truth. It stares in the mirror
I don't want to die. I just don't want to hurt anymore.
Yep, shit storm. He's at work, now I've burdened him, and he's all freaked thinking I'm going to do something crazy or hurt myself...
Just told my husband I'm never going back to AA. Here comes the storm...
I just feel like if I could finally get a stimulant prescription, I would never get hungry again, and be skinny, and happy...
I am so fat and gross and ugly and I hate my body so much I could just fucking cry an ocean forever
This stimulant thing will break me, it's only a matter of time, why bother fighting it? I know I want it. I don't even care. Skinny&gt;sobriety
FUCK IT. I HATE THIS. I HATE EVERYTHING. In an INSTANT everything goes from amazing to shit b/c I'M A FAILURE. That will NEVER change!
I'm not even really working the program, I don't have a sponser, I'm not doing the steps, I don't read the big book, SO WHY THE FUCK GO?!
It's like I'm such a fucking fake, why do I even bother with this... I'm never going to stay clean, I want to be fucking skinny I HATE THIS!
Just got back from AA where I admitted the whole stimulant situation and now I feel SO fucking stupid I never want to go back!
BTW to the people I also have as FB friends, sorry for the repeat posts. Just like sharing awesome random shit :)
Also I was informed hubby almost lost me in a poker game last night to said guy, lololol!
Me: \"So I heard you want my husband's dick.\"\nHubs coworker: \"No, I want your husband's wife.\"\nOh. Guess I'm a pimp :D
When random people who don't follow you or you them fave a tweet w/o tags... like where did you come from?
@AshleySparklez PSH, you're super gorgeous already! But grats :3 &lt;3
So today is Saturday, means I've lost, eh, like 7lbs in 1.5wks. Not bad! Could be worse!
lost 2 lbs since her last weigh-in! Warriorgirl2013's lost 15.2 lbs so far. #myfitnesspal
But really like super yay, below 175 again for first time in fucking FOREVER :D
BODY WHY YOU CONFUSE ME SO MUCH I HATE YOU WTF!
Okay okay THIS is fucked up... Ate like a horse yesterday including two HUGE bowls of lite rocky road ice cream and LOST 2LBS. WTF!!!
@TheFiFiD  that's pretty much what hubby said. Give Straterra a chance then if it's not working switch Dr's/meds.
This is like the only place I feel like I can just let it all hang out. Like whatever, you know? It's anonymous and we're like stranger fam.
&lt;c&gt; b/c I been \"doing so well\" and he doesn't want to see me back in my old ways or whatever. Fuck. Fuck. Fuuuck. No right answer is there..
I can't really talk to anyone about it and be completely honest. Except like my husband. Who says I should give the Strattera a chance &lt;c&gt;
Been going through this huge back &amp; forth about seeing a different Dr to get stimulants for my ADHD, whether it's addict behavior or needed.
I could sniff out drugs at a 5-year-old's lemonade stand.
By guy, I mean doctor. It's legit. Should have said that lol
So my coworker who also has ADHD is on amphetamines. He's going to write down the guys number. Hopefully no more a Straterra!!
I feel likea fucking rabbit. Crunch crunch crunch... #carrots
Omg is it the weekend yet??? #tgif
I feel like if you're not being hospitalized for malnutrition, you don't really have an ED. It's wrong but that's what my brain thinks...
I don't get it... I eat only fruits and veggies and maintain or lose like a 1/4lb. I eat ONE bad thing and gain 1.5lbs... #cry #failure
Yay me :3 #sobriety #AA #2months #recovery http://t.co/sl43Jy01z0
@DaneCook Best. Hashtag. Ever.
Off work, finally home relaxing. So tired. Thinking nap before AA. Get my 2-month chip tonight! :3 #AA #sobriety
Hubbilicious might get this weekend off, ahhhh! A whole weekend! #crossfingers!
Chillin chillin like a villain, just missing my baby... So lonely... :'(
Only have 15min for break. So I gotta power it down.
Scarfing food like a piggy. All veggies and fruit though. Oink oink!
lost 1.2 lbs since her last weigh-in! Warriorgirl2013's lost 14.6 lbs so far. #myfitnesspal
Wooow, I am a seriously judgemental asshole...
Alright, the super fatties are rollin' in. Time to go...
Frozen yogurt for supper is the best supper.
Besides, the only other things I've eaten today is an apple, strawberries, carrots, and a single slice of 45c bread. So I'm good :)
Having Yogurt Hut for like the 3rd time in a week. Under 100c for 5oz of frozen yogurt, you can't beat that...
Ahh, EDs telling other EDs to eat more and stop hating on themselves. How about you stop being a hypocrite?
I'm very happy with my strawberries, carrots, and apple :3 #healthfreak #healthynerd
I try so hard not to judge, but it grosses me out, esp watching them eat like hot pockets and shit... so nasty...
So, I work at a call center and literally more than half the people are obese, and prob a quarter are morbidly so. Sad, but motivating.
@WhisperingCuts sowwy :(
@WhisperingCuts no
@WhisperingCuts fuck, you are on a roll, girl!!
Btw, I hit 2mos clean and sober yesterday :) woohoo! #sobriety #AA #yay
lost 1.8 lbs since her last weigh-in! Warriorgirl2013's lost 13.4 lbs so far. #myfitnesspal
Work now... ugh. Not in the mood. Short day today though, only 6hrs.
Why am I still grieving over something that was lost so long ago...
Holy fuck, really in depth confusing dream last night about my ex and my husband... guess I have been wondering about him lately...
completed her food and exercise diary for 08/11/2013 and was under her calorie goal #myfitnesspal
Hubby had his one day off yesterday so we went out to eat. I gained 3lbs. What. The. Fuck. #ihatemyself
So full, OMG I'm going to burst. But all healthy stuff so I have so way to binge on shit food. Staying positive :3
On lunch break just sitting outside eating carrots and cantaloupe with a bottle of water. Today's been good :)
Thursday I ate over 1000c &amp; lost 2.5lbs. Yesterday I ate under 300c &amp; gained .5lbs... The fuck!! YOUR ARGUMENT IS ILLOGICAL!!!
completed her food and exercise diary for 08/09/2013 and was under her calorie goal #myfitnesspal
Going to wait until I can't stand it, then eat a huge salad &amp; frozen veggies until I'm so full I couldn't possibly eat the shit he's making.
My dad is cooking now. FML. Smells so fucking good. Need to chill. I can't ruin the whole day just for 5min of pleasure.
#fasting, just over 20hrs I think and everything is starting to look mouthwatering. Fuck my life. *chugs water* #weak
Finally Nair-d off my mustache, unibrow, and hairy knuckle man-feet. Feeling slightly better.
What the actual fuck?! Ive lost another 1.5lbs just since this morning!! :D #winning #fasting
Forget it... I just can't. I'm so upset now..
Prob the worst thing is that I have NO ONE that I can talk about this with.. its so embarrassing and painful.
Seriously feel like crying right now just thinking about it... It makes me feel SO UGLY. What man doesn't want sex all the fucking time?
If I want something, I got to get him ready then hope I'm ready then 10mins later its over. I usually get off but never fully satisfied tbh.
I want so badly for him to look at me with hungry eyes, but he's never been that type. Proves that I AM a disgusting cow-wife.
Hubs texted me: \"Be ready for me tonight. ;)\" Nothing. Like that means less than dick to me, pardon the pun, but for real...
@AshleySparklez my mom's said things similar before lol. *pats* I just laugh it off. She's the only one allowed to though.
Taking an Ambien and going to sleep all day so I don't eat. Nighty night.
At least I took down the pics from the bad night, all the cuts and shit, as well as the hospital photos of my face. Don't need the reminder.
Just looked at all my old pictures on here and holy fuck, I don't know how I could ever doubt I'm an alcoholic... #AA #sobriety #2months
@WhisperingCuts Nooooooooooo, I'm a fugly fat mess :( Icky...
@WhisperingCuts *blush* I like your account. Just stalked it and stuff... Saw your last weight post. Super jealous :3
@WhisperingCuts Hai *waves* *writes long random creepy tweet* *erases it* Hai :3
I forgot how much time I can get lost in Twitter... Kinda nice when you're avoiding the kitchen.
@livefastdiethin fasted for 4days and didn't puke but was forced to eat finally b/c I got a nasty nasty throat infection.
@tearss_ yep :) drink lots and lots of water. It counteracts bloat and water weight gain. &lt;3
@tearss_ drinking water doesn't cause water weight... Not drinking it does. Or too much soda/salt can cause you to retain...
Sooo, 6-8weeks... I think if I can drop 5lbs a week min, I'd be a happy hostess. I just can't give up this time. It's too fucking important.
Man, time needs to go by faster. Like 1.5, 2 months from now, there's going to be 20 drunk firefighters at my house. #holla #troublemaker ;)
When people weigh as much as you want to lose... It's like, can I throw you up and just be skinny now? Fucking embarrassing :'(
@livefastdiethin lol! Oh man, I don't envy you &lt;3
Finally looked up Strattera online. I have ADHD and apparently got prescribed the only nonstimulant drug in the US... Lucky me -.-
lost 0.8 lbs since her last weigh-in! Warriorgirl2013's lost 13 lbs so far. #myfitnesspal
Binge last night didn't seem to slow me down, dropped near another lb today! :D
Oooh, I hear the teapot whistling! Coffee bein' made. Gots to go get meh some :)
Changed my SW to HW in bio b/c it's more accurate. I never really \"started\" this fuckery. It started me. We don't choose our EDs. They do.
Nobody is going to \"just stop\" cutting, but there is no \"safe\" way to cut. Just shut up. Fucking bads. I hate Twitter sometimes.
And you all fucking know I'm a fucking cutter myself, not just some girl who thinks she knows. I fucking know. I fucking know...
Just read \"If you're going to cut, do it safely...\" How about if you're going to give advice to young girls, don't be fucking ignorant?!
Just encourages me more to slim down before the big BBQ. Not that'd I'd ever cheat, of course... &gt;.&gt;
Fine. Fuck you. FUCK YOU. I was thinking of your coworker when I masturbated anyways. #hornywifeprobs
I complain last night once again about how little we have sex &amp; openly please myself right next to him this morning. Fucking nothing.
My husband couldn't bother to kiss me, fuck me, or tell me he loves me before work, but took the time to put the dog in bed &amp; tuck him in...
Did good all day until tonight, then mini-binged. So ashamed. I need to fucking drop some weight! Thinking about fasting tomorrow.
Someone brought small cookies to AA :( I ate three... Oh well. It's still been a decent day. Feel guilty though...
I love following people who tweet a lot. If you don't tweet, its like, what's the point?
@Glass1ncision I don't mean to be weird &amp; creepy but... I love your tweets and like stalking you O.O lol :) &lt;3
I actually got called skinny today by a new coworker, just randomly in conversation. I started laughing. Like really?
burned 181 calories doing 45 minutes of Walking, 2.5 mph, leisurely pace #myfitnesspal
lost 0.4 lbs since her last weigh-in! Warriorgirl2013's lost 12.2 lbs so far. #myfitnesspal
\"I should tweet that, gimme my phone.\"\nHubby: \"Ugh, you're on Twitter again??\"\nOops...
I'm so fat they could name a continent after me.
completed her food and exercise diary for 08/07/2013 and was under her calorie goal #myfitnesspal
In break room at work and 90% of the boys are playing video games or reading comics. God, I love my job lol! #nerdpower #geekmadness
Start first day of training at my new job in 20min. When I get anxious, I have to pee. Training is 8.5hrs long, OMG... Stop drinking, OMG!
@livefastdiethin thank you! Totally agree. I hate all this \"follow for a follow?\" shit. If I don't want to see your shit, no, won't follow.
Sorry for massive tweetfest, just had to get all that out. Plus I have an hour to kill before work :) Hope everyone's having a good morning!
Since I had to take Hubby to work this morn I didn't have time for my salad, so second best: Denny's fit skillet. 330c. Then coffee til din.
I'm seriously on this huge natural high from all this attention, its intoxicating. I want more. Got to fucking lose! I'm so ready! :)
Were also hosting an end of fire season BBQ for all the guys. Got to be in super weight loss mode to look tiptop for it! :)
God, I feel like a giddy school girl!! This is so motivating to lose weight too, which is fucking awesome.
AND finally saw his face this morn since he wasn't wearing sunglasses, and yes, it's as easy on the eyes as his fucking sexy bod :D ;)
Also, Harris, sexy firefighter #2 (Hubs is #1 of course) was serious about the swinging thing lol!! Now Hubby is like, \"Noo, you're mine...\"
So new words from the firefighter crew regarding me. Apparently I'm a \"8/9 on a 1-10 scale.\" Ack! Whaaa?! Are they blind?? :O #blush
lost 0.8 lbs since her last weigh-in! Warriorgirl2013's lost 11.8 lbs so far. #myfitnesspal
Actually loss of appetite AND weight loss. Yay! Finally good side effects! I could use less food :) #crossesfingers
Pill doctor is putting me on Straterra. No stimulants for psycho me :( Guess its for the best. These have a side effect of weight loss tho!!
Why do you guys use that annoying ask app and make everyone read your shit if you're just going to be a smartass and not answer?
lost 1.6 lbs since her last weigh-in! Warriorgirl2013's lost 11 lbs so far. #myfitnesspal
@Fallingstar_x I care about you... :( I haven't forgotten about you &lt;3
In a complete post-purge state: shaky, lethargic, cold hands/feet, pale, droopy eyes, tired... God, I love/hate/love/hate it so much...
Nobody likes me... Not even the people that I pay to help me...
Fucking therapist just told me to doublecheck that I didn't miss anything on chain analysis... Now she's not texting back...
Did a half-assed chain analysis to give my therapist tomorrow. I should have seen this coming. I'm such a fucking fuckup, even in recovery..
Purged for first time in a long time. So much for that never purging thing... I feel gross and my nose gushed blood and I'm fat.
@mermaiidsushi thank you &lt;3
@crazilylovely shit, I need these! As reminders not to slip back into darkness...
I've actually seen pregnant EDs claim that they now have BED b/c they \"binge\" and are \"fat\". BITCH, YOU FUCKING PREGNANT! #facepalm
And no, I don't have BED. Or Anorexia. I'm a recovering Bulimic/EDNOS. And not stupid. I actually look up facts. Try it sometime.
It's so fucked that even people W/ EDs have such fucking ignorant views on EDs. Research before you fucking speak.
That's like saying you skip a few meals you're Anorexic. It doesn't fucking work like that so please STFU.
Just b/c you binge or overeat does not mean you have Binge Eating Disorder, OMFG twig bitches get OVER yourselves!
Why can't I just be confident and happy w/ my body the way it is? It's like losing all that weight meant nothing if I'm not happy...
Despite it being 8am, I'm debating taking an Ambien and just sleeping the day away. Been up since like 1:30am...
Owwwwwwwww, my stomach huuuuuuuuurts &gt;:( I need to keep an emerg stash of laxatives for these cases. Just to take one. Just one.
Not eating for the rest of the day. Period. Done.
Just calculated the calories from the cookies I ate: 855... 855!! Fucking kill me now I'm so fat oh my God I hate myself UGH!!!
I'm so bored. Can I just make the damn cookies then throw them away? :(
@JeneURock Thanks :) &lt;3
@JeneURock Yep, 2mos next week :)
@AnasWhale Hai cutie-face! (I'm not either ^.^)
I find it hilarious that I lose more followers when I actually tweet than when I go AWOL. Fuck you, I tweet a lot. #sorrynotsorry
WHY YOU TRY TO MAKE ME FATTER! &gt;:( God, I need to fucking move out... Just saving up for the summer.
She buys fucking like 8 boxes of cookie and brownie mix to \"make for the firefighters\", makes two boxes, then leaves for a week. Fuck you.
Stupid mom, WHY YOU BUY FUCKING SO MUCH COOKIE BOX MIX?! I hate you...
Hai, can I make cookies at 5am since I have insomnia? But then I would eat them all... :( #sadface #fat
It's so funny b/c I was just so happy that I could actually fit into a swing! I'm smaller than I was in fucking 6th grade! How fucking sad!
Ahh, #sobriety... I kinda love this pic. #picslip #narcissist #judgeme http://t.co/XVYthdeSuZ
And b/c I'm a narcissist, I'm going to plague you w/ an unrequested #picslip since I've been off Twitter for a while. http://t.co/MMemrHoMBw
Hey! There's actually more seeders than leechers for once! Fucking holla! Got to love file sharing ^.^
Wait... IT'S MONDAY! TRUE BLOOD WAS ON LAST NIGHT, OMFG WHY AM I NOT DOWNLOADING IT!!! #littlegirlscream
When someone replies or favourites a tweet and you check and think, \"WHY AM I NOT FOLLOWING YOU?!\" *follows* *feels like a douchebag*
Hubby said he was thinking that too and agreed. I got to protect myself and my sobriety at all costs. I'm just getting my life back.
I fessed up to Hubs about it and made him promise to keep him away from me. He's not welcome in our home or anywhere around me.
I just kept thinking how easy it would be to get. How close by. He even lives in the same tiny town -.-
Had a pretty triggering night after finding out a coworker of Hubby's does coke and meth. (A firefighter, wonderful right? -.-)
@ObsidianVormund They're like super tight already. I kept harassing him like, \"Have you seen his junk? Is it bigger than you?\" Bwahaha!
@ObsidianVormund Lol, well he wasn't sure if he was joking or not but he's seen pics of the wife and said he'd probably do it, haha!
Went through following and cleared out all the inactives. So happy to see that nearly everyone I specifically remember is still here &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
I don't even know.
So, wait, a really really sexy firefighter who has seen my scarred up fuckshit of arms openly wants to have sex w/ me? BIRTHDAY?! WHAAA?!
Oh, and the icing on the cake is that happens to be the guy who noticed my arms and was totally cool w/ it. Told Hubby his sis used to cut.
Like whaaaat? Is it my birthday?
My husband's firefighter crew apparently thinks I'm really cute. One guy (who is fucking HOT) even suggested us swinging w/ him&amp;his wife O.O
@SickBeingObese if you ever need to talk, I'm here to listen &lt;3&lt;3 sending lots of love your way
@SickBeingObese oh my god, I'm so sorry :( xoxo. I'm doing good, sober and in recovery. Just got a job.
First day of work at first job in 9mos starts now! Wish me luck :)
@ObsidianVormund thank you &lt;3&lt;3
@missoutofcontrl yay congrats!!
@SickBeingObese hey hon, how you been? It's been a while &lt;3 been thinking about you
@ObsidianVormund thank you :) I'm really happy about it. No matter how tempting the drugs &amp; alcohol, #sobriety is so much better!
@ObsidianVormund &lt;3 I have a lot to go before I'd even be close to underweight but I don't want to get caught in the whole ED life again
Ahhhhhhhh! I want out of here! I feel like my head is going to explode! I want shit MY WAY. I want to count and eat or not eat! UGH. FUCK.
My dad is an amazing cook. But it makes it impossible to count cals (God, I don't even want to imagine...) I miss living on my own...
He's over 300lbs. Even after gaining a little back, I'm still holding steady at 180. So, yeah. My way is better. #notsorry
My dad is the guy who makes pasta every night and when I complain says, \"Don't eat it.\" I'm the one who's like, \"Don't buy it.\"
Supposedly my dad is leaving on Monday, so might be an opportunity to kick off a short 24-48hr fast. We'll see. #crossesfingers
I love my twit-bitches! I miss your sexy-ass faces and skinny-ass bodies, despite my severe envy. Yall keep me in check. &lt;3
I miss Twitter for all my sad, sick, angry, and just random shit that goes on. Facebook is only for happy shit. Mine's sparse...
I know better than anyone that you either take recovery as a whole or stay sick and die. I can't pick and choose my illnesses.
And I don't want to start purging again. But living at home is making it really fucking hard to monitor intake and eat less. Fuck me.
Precariously thinking about coming back to Twitter for some thinspovation. I need to lose some fucking weight already.
Argue, argue, argue; all we do is argue...
@Anarexicmia Sending friend request, hope I found the right person, lol :P
@Anarexicmia I am. Just not using Twitter very much cause of triggering. I have a FB now though
Why am I always so angry... Why am I always so sad...
I mean, some of you have become closer than family. Shit, I want to invite y'all to my wedding whenever I get to have it!
@ObsidianVormund I'm okay, doing a lot of thinking. Just been pulling away from Twitter lately, trying to reconnect to the world :\\
I'm slowly pulling more and more away from Twitter, trying to focus more on recovery. I do have a FB now if anyone wants to add me, DM :) &lt;3
burned 204 calories doing 60 minutes of Walking, 2.0 mph, slow pace#myfitnesspal
@ObsidianVormund from this morning, yep :)
Starving No More!  Week of 6/2/13\nhttp://t.co/vdqslcfkw4 http://t.co/6iDAHtIxjv
Here's the pie I made for the potluck :) I never get to bake for anyone so I got a little fancy-pants :P #AA http://t.co/OJ9CaqhqKQ
Waiting around to go to AA. Have to hit that special time zone where I'm not too early but also not late.
@UnstableWarrior TMD, rather... not TMJ
Between the bulimia, depression (causing me to neglect brushing and such), and now this trauma to my jaw, I'm nervous... #dentist
I'll have to see a dentist to determine for sure. Probably a good thing... I haven't seen a dentist in near a year.
Figured out what's wrong with my jaw.. the blows to my face from my seizures three weeks ago caused TMJ. I suspect, anyways...
I am nothing if not my heritage. And that's something I'm damn proud of. #Italian
I can sleep and relax again, I can HAVE SEX again, I don't want back on that shit :'( #akathisia #Latuda #sideeffects
Just so happy to have the side effects of the Latuda gone (since I skipped last night) that I got carried away :((
Bad binge day, bad bad bad! But I took what binge food I had left and tossed it, money be damned. I shouldn't have bought it to begin w/.
Can I please wake up and be 125lbs please? Please? PLEASE?
I made this :) so yummy! Practice for tomorrow's potluck at #AA http://t.co/0aUrkCl5Om
@insanity_art yay! Happy to see someone else having #edrecovery successes!
Didn't take my Latuda last night and behold, akethisia is nearly gone today. Not starting again until I get some Propranlol :( #sideeffects
It's food stamp day! Yay! I get to go shopping and eat! :D
Facebook is so boring :\\
Mauled hubby when he woke and asked him if I was 'sexy' and 'hot'. He's like, \"You're a 10.5... Out of 5.\" Aww :) He's the best &lt;3
Hubby and I just watched the kitty lay on my crotch and are just laughing hysterically at the implications, ROFL!! http://t.co/mDkC3rsW8l
I have a whole 8 friends on Facebook. I just refuse to whore myself out just to feel important. #sorrynotsorry
Ugh, should I go or no, should I go or no, should I go or no.... I'm so lazy, I don't want to. I want to go walking or something, not AA...
There's a noon meeting today in my little town that's somewhere different than the normal church. Thinking about going... #AA #sobriety
@Glass1ncision &lt;c&gt; a dis/insult to want something specific. It's okay to say you don't like something/want someone specific. TOTALLY ok :)
@Glass1ncision Tats are tricky b/c you want what you want (it's YOUR body) but you don't want to 'dis' an artist. Just remember, it's not&lt;c&gt;
@Glass1ncision If I could've gotten my second tat by my first artist, I would've too. Trust your wise mind ;) &lt;3
@Glass1ncision &lt;c&gt; just request to schedule an appt w/ your person specifically. Or ask to see portfolios if you don't know yet :)
@Glass1ncision ABSOLUTELY! Most (good) places even have portfolios out so you can pick your artist. Each has strengths/weaknesses. I'd &lt;c&gt;
The worst part is right now, the weed actually exacerbates the akathisia. Horrible horrible feeling....
Found the word: akathisia. That's what I have. Doc wants to add Propranolol to help it. #Latuda #sideeffect

I feel like I've been a huge freaking oinker today when in reality, I've eaten about 660c so far. It's 4pm. Last I checked, that was good.
Pill Dr called me back. Dropping me down to 40mg of Latuda and possibly add something for the restlessness, which has a big fancy name.
@AshleySparklez lol yikes that sucks.
This is fucked, I have like boundless energy!! Like sprint a marathon energy! I can't stop moving! #manic?? D:
@AshleySparklez lol, it is fun. My husband said Canada doesn't really put out coupons and if they do, they're highly regulated or something.
W/e, its 80c and healthier than half the shit I eat... #babyfood
Mmm... &gt;.&lt;
I'm going to eat this baby food I just got. Why? B/c I'm hungry. And it was free. Bottoms up... http://t.co/1sd6l2Jz4l
As expected, the cashiers here in S. OR are sooooo less gay with coupons than fucking GA. Fuck you Georgia, dicks! #sorrynotsorry
@fallingstarxox yeah, but I OD'd on it, so it has bad connotations for me...
Couponing has actually made me money today. $0.88, courtesy of WalMart. Plus, some guy randomly gave me money... God's looking out &lt;3
New medication is really starting to bother me... Jittery and agitated.. #Latuda #ADHD #bipolar #BPD #anxiety

@insanity_art Pretty sure I've seen that one. Sucks that the only time I hear #BPD on TV is in crime shows portrayed as serial killers :(
@insanity_art I feel like this ALL the time :( Especially lately...
@Glass1ncision Oh, I haven't read it, just seen the movie. Good movie though. I'm sure the book is better since they always are.
@Glass1ncision Erm, I personally didn't, more just interesting how my stays in hospital were similar/different than as portrayed.
Got my local coupon group going on FB! So exciting! I actually have a couple members already!!! :D

At the store, Hubby's talking about how his firefighter job is going to give him abs and says loudly, \"I can't wait until I get hard!\" #ROFL
Scratch that last tweet, we got low fat ice cream at the store :D going to be at about 1300c for the day :) #recovery #winning
At 470c now and planning a healthy cod, broccoli, and roasted potato supper :) #happy but kinda disappointed I won't hit my 1200c goal :\\
Hubbilicious is FINALLY bringing meh some weeeeeed!!!!!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n*ahem*...\n\nYUUUUS!
@AshleySparklez Lol, I have three of those books too &lt;3
Whilst doing laundry, I randomly deeply inhaled my husband's shirt. It smelled so good I almost didn't want to wash it. #ComeHomeFromWork &lt;3
@AshleySparklez Also, I'll prob do the same thing, heh xo &lt;3
@AshleySparklez ZOMG, DON'T CARE, MUST HAVE! Lol, do they have a Furby app too? Rofl
Did my phone session for therapy since I couldn't afford the 60mile drive this week, and just had a nice bath. Finally starting to chill...
@AshleySparklez WOAH IS THAT AN APP?! Shit, I remember those!! #90skid
Someday I'm going to have to accept the harsh reality that I will never have a flat stomach w/o surgery b/c of my former morbid obesity...
Rejoined Facebook, the internet devil, to create a local group for couponing. Sue me.
lost 0.4 lbs since her last weigh-in! Warriorgirl2013's lost 13 lbs so far. #myfitnesspal
Going to go lay down in the spare room and hope I just sleep. Indefinitely.
God help me..
Sorry, honey, you married an addict. You knew this beforehand.
Great. Now my husband is completely pissed at me&amp;I'm still making him see if our dealer is still awake to drive 30miles to see him. Tonight.
My frozen check FINALLY cleared after some 10days and all I want right now is weed. I'm crying and throwing a big fucking fit at 10pm.

I feel seconds from trashing my house, exploding w/ rage just to get it out. Beating my fists against doors, walls, desks... I just want out
How the fuck am I supposed to be happy about #AA and #recovery when I'm still so hopelessly addicted to yet another substance... #crying
I'm acting like such a fucking addict again and I fucking hate it. He seems to think I LIKE it. I like being stupid, slow, and lazy? W/e...
Picking fights and getting angry at my husband b/c I'm STILL out of weed, 3rd day in a row... I can't sleep. I can't function.
Everybody's a goddamn expert these days. Get over yourselves.
@paper_thin Tell me about it! What's that quote? 'Opinions are like asses. Everyone has one and they all stink'? Heh.. so true..
Yeah, you fucking trolling WHITES! Lawl!
Ahahaha!!! Auto-correct just tried to change the word \"whores\" in my last tweet to \"whites\". ROFLMAO, too fucking funny...
@paper_thin Ugh, just reading that trash from those trolling whores makes me sick. Ignorance must be bliss b/c dealing w/ it fucking sucks.
\"@SkinnyySarah: Recovery is the most stressful and anxiety provoking thing I have ever experienced.\" OMG THIS
I. Am. Going. To. Claw. My. Face. Off. I NEED FUCKING WEED NOW OR I'M GOING TO OFF SOMEBODY!!!!
Fidgety fidgety fidgety... Why can't I stop shaking &gt;:( #ADHD #anxiety
Trying to reach outside my comfort zone and create a couponing group in my area. Think I already have one girl. Nervous! #anxiety #recovery

If my husband showed up with weed when he gets home, I might break a rib I'd be so happy...

It's a good thing I'm used to starving since we're completely out of cash and don't get more food stamps until the first. #hungry
@Anarexicmia @delucate You deserve so much better than that. &lt;3 xox
@Anarexicmia @delucate If it's only been a month and she's doing this, and you've talked to her about it w/ no change, I say break it. &lt;c&gt;
@Anarexicmia What's wrong? &lt;3
Do you think my husband would be upset if I tried to put black eyeliner on him? Nahhh... I don't think so :P
Neither my husband or I dance but somehow I keep seeing us dancing crazily to Panic At The Disco.... They have that effect, don't they, lol
\"Can't take the kid from the fight,\nTake the fight from the kid,\nSit back, relax,\nSit back, relapse again.\"
I'm so bored, it's paaaainful. Better get used to it if Hubby's going to be a firefighter. I'll have a lot of alone time :\\
\"It's okay to be afraid...\nbut it will never be the same.\nIt will never be the same.\"
@ObsidianVormund Ack, thank you! Me too. I was so nervous about the ED part of my #recovery, but I'm doing okay :) &lt;3
........... in the 170s again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D:D:D:D After MONTHS of plateau I finally break it DURING #RECOVERY! SO HAPPY! :D

Time to take my Pill De Nausea, aka, Latuda. Ugh. At least it puts me out fast so I don't suffer long. #Latuda #nausea #sleepytime
Really happy he did too b/c I'm sick of having to ask MY family for money so Hubby can get to/from work, do this class, etc. Seems unfair.
Said he'd not only loan him the money, but get it in by tonight so he can bring it to the class. God bless you dad-in-law. We owe you big &lt;3
I swallowed my pride and called everyone I could think of borrowing money from. This is a big deal. Luckily, his dad actually saved the day.
Hubby is once again trying to go to the firefighter class and we just now find out there's a $175 deposit... Can't catch a break...
New money problems arising right after I get out of my AA meeting where I complained about money problems...
Peeking out the window. Hubby's talking to one of the neighbour kids. I wonder if big daddy's not home :( Boooo... #drystonerprobs
@dysCONNECTED You deserve better than both those losers. You should make them both girlfriendless, lol.. just saying :) &lt;3
Here goes nothing...
Speaking of my dad, I wish he was back already. He wouldn't let me go dry :( He should be back in like 2wks. Can't wait that long though!
I'm jonesing real bad here and I know my neighbours grow but my husband's only talked to them like once. My dad knows them well though...
How do you ask someone you barely know who grows weed if you can have a taste w/o being completely obvious?
@theborderline94 I know!!! Totally agree! I was so excited in my email, so unlike my normal detached professionalism. HOPEHOPEHOPE!
More than getting a job, I hope that I can actually KEEP it. #BPD #BPDissues #fuckBPD
@theborderline94 Ugh, me neither, I feel you. Just really don't have a choice now... And thank you &lt;3
Three of the CL jobs were typical receptionist positions that I never hear back from. The other is a new coffee place opening. High hopes &lt;3
Sent resumes to four different Craigslist jobs, and printed five to take into the city on Tuesday. At least I'm trying... :\\
I'm choking on my own anger. My emotions suffocate me... I don't know how to safely express them. #BPD
Sorry, I'll stop, I'm just so angry/frustrated/PISSED THE FUCK OFF b/c people SUCK, shit is just so unfair, and never unfair in my favour...
So after gas, he takes home about $10 a shift. For 3hrs. And he's explained this to them and they just rage about hrs.
3hr shifts working minimum wage that he has to drive 30miles EACH WAY from our home to get to every day. I'm disgusted...
I bet money they're going to send him home soon already too since they only schedule him like 3hr shifts and he was 1.75hr \"late\". Bullshit.
@Scarsarebeaut_ love this idea! Helps track pay too
@Scarsarebeaut_ oh, the schedule. Yeah, I'll tell him that for future reference. Just wish there was something to prove it for this time :\\
It's amazing how little I eat when I'm not high. Not intentionally either, I'm trying to recover my ED too. It's weird...
Using the glare on your glasses as a rearview mirror...\n\nWhy yes, I DO have eyes in the back of my head, lol!
@Scarsarebeaut_ his what? Yeah, I don't understand how they can get away w/that! Kinda hope they fire him so we bleed them for unemployment!
@Fallingstar_x aww you're too sweet!
@Redcarder aw thank you :P I love them
Needless to say, were spending the rest of the afternoon filling out applications at other jobs. Did I mention fuck McDonald's?
They're lucky its not me working there. I'd fucking lose it. Fuck #McDonalds shitty food, shitty jobs, and shit people. FUCK YOU
We just drove 30miles to get him to this mysterious shift that he was \"scheduled\" only so he gets his ass chewed out for shit not his fault.
I am LIVID. McDonalds fucked over my husband on hours, CHANGES the schedule midweek, then has the nerve to YELL at him for being \"late\".

How many times have you been triggered? How many times has someone inadvertently made you snap? How many times have you made someone else?
Do you know what they call it in Criminal Minds when someone suddenly snaps and kills people? A trigger. Makes you think, doesn't it...
@ObsidianVormund :( it feels wrong. But I don't want to take a chance w/o it until hopefully my mood stabilizer kicks in..
I feel sick that I still smoke weed while in AA. But my family, even my therapist, doesn't want me to quit yet. Bad shit happens...
Hubby said he'll go chat up our neighbours in a bit. They grow right in their front yard, hoping they'll share a taste. God I'm a hypocrite.
Out of weed this morning, which is petrifying... Bad shit happens to me when I'm out...
Like, shit, I get enough of that from myself. After my last incident, Hubby wanted me to just delete my Twitter b/c of triggering.
Haven't been on lately b/c Twitter is honestly just depressing as fuck. Everybody is so negative, I can't stand it... #sorrynotsorry

At AA again. Feels like being in a room w/ like my dad and grandpa... Everyone looks at me like a daughter, breaks my heart...
@ProEmptyZero I don't. I've heard of DOTA but never played it personally. Is it an RTS? FPS?
I don't know why but more and more I've been drawn back to Portland. I keep wanting to schedule a visit for no reason. I miss it... #weird
But, it won't be until next February, I'll hopefully be about done w/ therapy, I'll have Ryan w/ me, and fuck the rest. Fuck the people.
I guess the only possibly negative aspect is that it's in PDX. Homebase. Very high chance of running into old crew. Exes. Friends. Ugh.
Nothing is more fun than being a girl showing up at a 500+ person gaming event w/ a sickass set-up and kicking ass in tournies. #PCgamers
Thinking I need to save up some money, completely rebuild my beastly computer, and hit up PDXLAN next February. I need some fun.
Who do I talk to when its my therapist who's being weird?
Someday...
I really want to create a postcard to send to #PostSecret but I don't know which of my many sins to share w/ it... :\\
Eat like shit for days and feel guilty? Lose weight. Have a good day and feel good for ONCE? Gain 3lbs overnight. #ofcourse
Planning on going to my first #AA meeting tomorrow right here in my little 1000pop town. #anxious. 10days sober tomorrow, yay me. #sobriety

Shout out to everyone who never asks for handouts and is always the first one to lend a hand.
All my plans to do with my taxes are out the window due to future lawyer bills my brother fucked me &amp; still owes me $250 but he can keep it
Alls a product of his arrogance and since he couldn't get to me he took the easiest path of least resistance and called the cops on me
He failed to mention him putting hands on my mother, threatening his house owner and breaking things in the house after I left the situation
My brother has never been on probation never been locked up or fucked by the police he has no idea what he is doing to me
My lawyer said to not update anything on FB but I will on here. Thanks guys for the support $600 later and another court date on the 30th
I'm turning myself in tomorrow
He sucks snitch Ass
Fuck my older. Bruv no blood of mine
My brother called the cops on me for kicking his ass and I'm going to jail later all

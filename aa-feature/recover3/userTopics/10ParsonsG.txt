Getting a train at 6 47 to work is gonna kill me
@anna_bolwell no I know don't worry 
@anna_bolwell haha no it's fine dads coming 
And then @anna_bolwell beeps you as she drives off in her fully functioning car 
Who even does that ... Oh yeah me
@lottssss genuinely crying
@lottssss  she's broken
Just put a whole tank of diesel in my petrol car #brilliant
I wish jezz was back on Cbb 
My dog just gave me the best cuddle and now I have to leave him to go to bed 
I need to stop drinking and going out
Can't sleep as feel like I'm spinning into a black hole
When you get in and just want to cuddle your dog at 4 in the morn but he isn't having any of it
When you ask Lottie if she needs the wifi password but she's already connected #truefriends
Lifts )
I'm so bad with technical stuff
I need confident people in my life not those that need constant reassurance, it's exhausting
And I've been an arsehole for the last 3 months apparently
Am I not allowed to have a fucking life
Best quote... Emma: \"I love boys\"
Claire told me to do it
YOLO #ymcaconference
Wanna go bed but wanna continue cuddling my dog
Hate it when people tag you in pictures where you look 20 stone and have a horrendous drunk face
Two fat ankles and covered in bruises
My body is fucked after oceana
My actions last night and my outfit were both appalling 
Anyone doing lifts 
@lottssss so cute isn't it! You can be the bride, I'll try and squeeze into the flower girls dress 
@lottssss I shared it first!!
Lyf
But yet I still have it in my life
I enjoy being single because of no jealously and no drama
Lottie Oakley is the bestest friend in the entire world
Gotta learn to stop watching sad films about dogs 
I envy people who are really close to their family
@_NathHumphreys yes we will
@_NathHumphreys I will not 
@_NathHumphreys literally hopefully forever
And happily
Never again will I attend liquid Friday
Note to self family are not available in a crisis
I have to put my hair up, moisturise all over, moisturise feet, put Vaseline on, moisturise hands and then lay down 
Literally have such a strict bed tin routine at home
And let's not forget my dogs
Except from towards my gals
I genuinely have no feelings or emotions
Love my gals more than life @JoDHolmes @emmalubega @laura_kingston_  
A lot of people could learn from this  https://t.co/nbOg176zE3
@MrBenjaminCane @Lowry_Hannah @HarrySelway @JoDHolmes it's not happening
As if the girls admitted they sat outside my house for 10 mins after dropping me off to watch my 21 year old brother undress himself
I literally don't reply to anyone... Why do I even have a phone
It's only 9:53 and all I can think about it playing beer pong
Woohoo Suns out 
Having a 14 year old dog is like potty training a 2 year old
Love cuddling and giving my dog lots of kisses at Christmas 
Need to shower and put on my new clothes and make up, but will I ... No
Hung over on Christmas Day what is life
9th nosebleed of the week currently taking place
My Twitter feed is so depressing I can't cope
I have a chocolate addiction
Anyone doing lifts tonight 
Boys are such bitches
The cat on the Sheba advert looks like such a player
I literally love my dog more than life itself
But life could be worse
And had 3 nosebleeds
Nearly wrote my car off/died today
Oh brilliant now having a nosebleed
Reminiscing on the time when I could go to bed and breathe out my nose
I don't think I'll cope if I lose my dog anytime soon
Marley and me has me crying rivers
Five things I currently can't live without https://t.co/0iwmzwc8I0
Paco Robanne Olympea 
The only way is up 
Having a cold is the worst thing
Fml

JB Never say never is a tune
Lies

That could be cool
I love Matty Taylor loads
@lottssss good idea!
@lottssss that was not an option!!
Tonight
Freezing cold man
@_NathHumphreys I'm getting a new phone &amp; number dude
That would be nice
Might just delete all social media so that I can't get contacted
What has life come to that it is normal to sleep in joggers and hoodies
Why am I so cold
It's time for the wham album to come out
Why does oli take 5 hours to get ready for a dog walk
Really wanna see Lottie tomorrow but she's got work 
I want you
Lifts???
@JoDHolmes yes way he's out tonight too
The thought of seeing fat boy from holiday tonight makes me v excited
Might have to get a bum reduction
@Lowry_Hannah nothing will it was fab! Make sure you water your co-op award winning flowers  
@Lowry_Hannah yes bae ... Won't quite live up to Liqo Friday will it 
Popworld tonight 
Was only supposed to be a quiet gb meal
So drunk I can't feel my legs
Such a good night with the girls - love them all so much 
R.i.p feelings
3 hours sleep and still going strong

Tiger was worth it though
Got work in 4 hours
Tomorrow night? 
It's true friendship 
When lotties makes you a cup of tea in a cup reading \"you're a cunt\"
Hunger games with @emmalubega is going to make me very happy 
Liquid is my guilty pleasure
What has life come too
Can't believe I've only just woke up
@Yazparsons93 hahaha love you
Really want a miniature sausage dog called woody
Feelings are not up for discussion
But hey it's just banter
Hate gutting mugged off
@zpcuk cheers buddy
I wonder what Liqo has in store for tonight
He's funny though so I'll let him off
Oli Evans is the bane of my life
Jk just bant

Have to spend an evening at lotties house having counselling when a boy hasn't replied to my message
What a throwback
Who remembers JLS
Feel like I should not go out until after Christmas
Why mingle when you can just be single
Money is tight right now and I don't like that feeling
Mic love stories make me happy 
So sleepy 
@lottssss don't worry I'll always be your heartless friend, you can count on it 
Why does life have to be so darn complicated
@lottssss am I being a bad influence on you? ;)
@_NathHumphreys what's up? Haha 
Why is it that so many weirdos have your number but the people you actually want to have it don't
Some of the messages Lottie gets makes me laugh 
Back at lotties aka my second home
Be grateful if I reply to you, it means I'm interested
Texting people is so much effort
@zpcuk I haven't got a man... So mine
Some boys are just uncontrollable
No the dick pic you \"accidentally\" sent me does not scare me
Freshly shaved smooth legs 
Life problems
@lottssss some of us have work Friday!
@lottssss Liqo Friday yes? ;) you need it more than I do 
Mostly so I can go back to Liqo again
I have a problem where each week I wish everyday goes quickly so that Friday comes quicker
@lottssss har har har 
From my dog
I love a cuddle
I make myself happy and that's the best way to be
I hate how much people rely on others to make them happy
No bra days are my favourite kind of days
@lottssss I'm calling dibs elsewhere haha ;)
@lottssss haha, no Lottie I will not share my boys with you 
I would like to marry both ant dec
Why is it so cold
Literally want to go camping in the middle of nowhere away from all humans
Banter
One word to describe last night ... Madness
Spoons, liquo or both is the question for tomorrow night
My first weekend of not drinking in months has failed ... Alcoholics Anonymous here I come https://t.co/eCwv2KFROG

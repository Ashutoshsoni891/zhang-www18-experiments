It may sound gross but, cottage cheese and red hot sauce are so good mixed together. 
Want some really good Mexican food
Seeing the guy you love playing with kids and making them laugh just makes you love him 10x more. 
So I hurt my wrist and I don't even know how.... Cool
@kalcium_ we don't have a set time, but I'll let you know tomorrow
@AriLizDoyle and me
@kalcium_ pride with Bridget and I tomorrow?
Tammy and Bobby are like my second parents, and having them meet Tyler is a very important thing to me.
Beach day  http://t.co/vAZwXmufKe
Tyler and I are always up so late. Always.
It's a weird feeling talking to my mom about things I did last summer and I don't even remember any of the things. 
Wish I was as confident as you  https://t.co/UH3NrEIQhd
My grad party is coming up soon, I would love to see a bunch of people! 
It's a perfect beach day
Need help and ideas on where to apply for a job
Pretty damn sure she was high too. 
So Ty and I got Taco Bell, and the girl at the drive thru window asked if we wanted sauce and she gave us all of this http://t.co/SvpEfy04Wk
Today marks my six months being sober and I am celebrating it by having a slushy from Sonic 
I hate having to drive everywhere if people want to hang out. Why don't you guys have your driver license?!
Someone needs to go camping with us.
Amen to this  https://t.co/cchDFBoOW7
@AriLizDoyle  I do!
It'd be nice if I had friends and they actually wanted to hang out with me.
I have an obsession with the Fast and Furious movies.
Ya know, nobody texts me anymore.... So 612-418-3848 hmu
I'm just not comfortable with hanging out with people who use or relapse repeatedly...
@jbrandt1010  https://t.co/GrpRBBgiiB
So Tyler and I are planning on going camping maybe this week, who is wanting to join?!
You mean the world to me. https://t.co/k6oGlNmd3q
@catbitchh 
I posted this on insta, but I have blue/grey hair. http://t.co/AQJGQYYsCa
@catbitchh we gotta hang out soon. Purple and blue hair gals 
Ugh yes  https://t.co/D6neA3BBbx
http://t.co/ORLuYDfzwP
This is adorable. My baby with a baby.  http://t.co/QIWMCZR0ed
I'm so exhausted, but working with the little kids and Tyler today was really nice. 
Gotta be up at 5 tomorrow morning 
Except for Tyler, I don't even really know who my real/true friends are.
Honestly hate how depressed I get. Don't even know why I am and I hate it.
Ugh just the sight of you driving in the opposite direction than me is giving me an anxiety attack.
Haha just kidding. Nothing can stop my incredible love for him. 
Tyler think Nutella is gross, I don't think I can love him anymore
Babe is blonde now  https://t.co/jpBjEAtqYr
I don't know what to call my hair color https://t.co/cOabkRpoMo
 https://t.co/aetbJQYfGR
I miss my best friend...
Well my hair is an ugly pastel blue/purple color but whatever...
Tyler and I bleached our hair. 
@Bianca_Moose I just saw that at the drive in, it was so good!
I'm so grateful to have Tyler. 
I'm sad when it rains bc I think of you and start to miss you again...
It's about that time to get another tattoo
@michaela_uveges Mae Whitman is my favorite. 
Didn't get a single mosquito bite on Florida, but that day I get back in MN I get five... Gr8 to be back.
@michaela_uveges such a good show!
@ShelbsxMarie or you know, not?
Need to go fishing and/or boating really soon!
@kalcium_ oh awesome!! 
@kalcium_ where do you work?
So happy to be back home!!! 
I'm very proud of myself for how far I've come in my sobriety. Looking back on how I was disgusts me.
I can't think of the last time I've been this sore. But that's what you get when you spend two 12 hour days at amusement parks.
I'm coming home today!!
Feel bad for missing all my friends grad parties 
@amandalarson24 I'll have to see you when I get back 
Not wearing my septum ring feels so weird.
This heat is ridiculous. 
@amandalarson24 so sad and so sorry I can't make it . I'm in Florida until tomorrow.
I may not look happy, but it's summer vacation and I am.  https://t.co/CasCeGj9Un
My sexy man  https://t.co/xQKKGtMC83
@beccanbaker 
@beccanbaker we are hanging out when I get back. I will bring you to the drive in. 
I miss @beccanbaker 
Where is @Dmndlife952 to give me a full body massage when I need him? 
Over 12 hours of constant walking and standing. I am so tired and my feet hurt.  #StillWorthItThough 
I rarely talked to Madde but when I did/do, I just get this feeling I can talk to her about anything. She's such a wonderful girl. 
@ShelbsxMarie hey, we should start talking and hanging out again! I definitely need a girl friend. 
So much fun photo bombing people, then having a drunk lady and join you. 
@_SamiBrandt http://t.co/uAXa97iyh4
 http://t.co/CdbV8NKnkB
Though I may not enjoy the books and movies of Harry Potter, the park here is still amazing and so fun to be in. 
@kardashiyanz hi, I love u too.  I am doing quite well. And I hope you're doing a lot of biking with Cray and enjoying summer vacay. 
@kardashiyanz is that even a question to ask????
He is so cute! But this is so funny to me.  http://t.co/iZMn8nDXdo
The humidity is too much for me to handle. It's ruining my fun at universal.
I just got this new phone and with my luck of having my old iPhone, I would crack the screen of the new one.
Thanks for being the cutest, most annoying, but especially the greatest little sister. Love you https://t.co/Lh6jxRCAyN
Being on vacation is wonderful, but I'm so ready to go home and be with Tyler. 
@Dmndlife952 too true!  https://t.co/pliVSkpBPh
@rae_armstrong_ I miss you too!!!! 
@rae_armstrong_ definitely going to go to you for my next one. 
@SamanthaSwierc1 ok bby 
when I get back I'm going to start to plan a camping trip, so anyone who wants to go, hmu!! 
Four more days and I'll be back with my love bug  http://t.co/0wkaperV7y
@kardashiyanz I want to hang out with you and Cray when I get back from Florida.
Someone text me? I can't sleep.
UGH WHY, why are you on my mind tonight
This is exactly why I'm sad https://t.co/WmxHKD02Yv
I've been depressed for awhile but it's now getting worse into the night, and I really feel like I have no one I can talk to.
Sigh... 
But then again I don't know the whole story and all the sides to it. So I shouldn't assume or judge.
It honestly makes me think it's because they're too scared to say this stuff to the persons face, so they say it behind a screen.
I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE BRING DRAMA ON TO SOCIAL MEDIA
Same  https://t.co/DRhdGivPvm
@Healy_Lauren @lannadelgay @mariearos @gucc1beltz possibly, but you're all replying and making it worse. You're adding fuel to the fire.
@lannadelgay @Healy_Lauren @mariearos @gucc1beltz We are done with high school now &amp; never have to see each other. So why bother with this?
@lannadelgay @Healy_Lauren @mariearos @gucc1beltz I'm not wanting to be involved, but why is this still happening?
Time for a nap 
So this is what's happening in the sky right now http://t.co/E0lcuBgoVX

Good morning y'all  https://t.co/6Bfr55T9AI
@alliekagerrr it looks normal
@ProblyDntLikeU we should see Magic Mike 2
@ProblyDntLikeU once I get back from Florida, we should chill with Sammy 
@ProblyDntLikeU I see you, creeping on my Twitter 
@Dmndlife952 just means that I'm one day closer to coming back home.
First full day here and I feel like shit. 
Going to be difficult to sleep without Tyler next to me. 
No filter needed.  http://t.co/3m7VbXGhFD
Just landed! 
@Dmndlife952  https://t.co/QDfZu4OEUE
Well that was the first time the ball to my tongue ring came off when I was eating. Lucky I didn't swallow it.
A week without Ty, how will I deal? 
I leave for Florida in twelve hours. 
I just want to go back home to Tyler. 
I'm gonna really miss these guys. http://t.co/gd8BAzI1r8
So I'm really thinking of dying my hair a pastel color 
So Tyler and my sister are hanging out together at home when I'm babysitting.
Today marks one month with my love, Tyler.  http://t.co/BpgCzMAPxk
Tyler and I weren't about to see the Avengers for the fifth time, so we are now eating Perkins. 
Third time is the charm 
So incredibly proud of all my fellow friends that graduated from Armstrong tonight. You all rock! 
Was so happy and grateful to have my grandma be at my graduation yesterday.  http://t.co/ao00STYdhU
Honestly when am I not at the drive in? 
Rolling my eyes at all these guys talking about ecigs and mods 
Can't stand people who don't manage their money. I get some splurge here and there, but all the time? That's just a waste of money.
I hate that I've been missing you a little lately.
I just don't want to be here at the moment.
What is wrong with me right now? I'm in the middle of having an anxiety attack and being so depressed.
Couldn't have made it to this day with out the love, care and support from my family.  https://t.co/7jdFaE7xr9
Just graduated and there are still people having drama on social media... I just don't understand what the point of it is...
I DID IT!!!!  http://t.co/AdnneBFp9J
Storms just get me more hyped up for graduation.
@Bianca_Moose thank you so much! 
I am nervous but very much excited for this evening. 
I GRADUATE TOMORROW
Same bc sick life  https://t.co/Iw416up3iO
WHY DO I ALWAYS GET SICK AT THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR
I graduate Wednesday and then on Sunday I'm going to Florida. 
Still have to see @KeenanCasanova live sometime before I die.
Love him with my whole heart https://t.co/iLVHP9XC6a
http://t.co/Nkc4L5i6ef
But the difference is that I'll be able to talk to him when I'm gone.
I don't know how I'm going to go a week without seeing him, if it was hard enough with it only being 3 days.
Time needs to go by faster, because I want to see Tyler.
Had the idea of going to the drive in tonight, but nobody is texting me back.
Its time to lose weight and start working out so I can be confident in my own skin
@Dmndlife952  https://t.co/CW41M9uDI8
Enjoy the little things http://t.co/15bLmg3zb2
To have a good cig, you need to have a good pack job.
I'll be sending out invites to my grad party that is July 11th, so anyone who wants to go, dm me your address. 
@kinsleyjane3 I REMEMBER WRITING THOSE
I just wish I could talk to Tyler right now
I've missed Quinn so much, I'm glad we are talking again.
Sigh, I just want it to be Monday.
What do you do when you're boyfriend is gone for the weekend and nobody wants to hang out? Watch Sex and the City.
Not a single person has texted me all day. Love you guys 
In need of a pack of cigs....
I wish New Horizon would call me back. 
Not having my morning cig with Tyler is 
My evening is spent shopping with mom and getting sushi for dinner. 
I already miss Tyler.
Just posted a photo https://t.co/7EV2v3RYMA
After spending all day everyday with Tyler and now he's going to be gone until Monday is a weird feeling for me.
Lol at people who are desperate enough to make a tinder 
Lol at people who are desperate enough to make a tinder 
Spent the morning at the Sculpture Garden with my love  http://t.co/cTbt0VXoTv
I feel like you're holding back or not telling me something... It makes me sick to my stomach
Got a new phone! 
The fact that Tyler and my sister get along so well makes me incredibly happy. :-)
@AriLizDoyle check your DM box
@lannadelgay  https://t.co/ojFsDXrvgY
@AriLizDoyle oh fuck
OH MY GOD! I didn't even acknowledge that on saturday I had my 5 months!! I honestly forgot all about it... haha
I do not like the first or last day of the school week because of check in, and I am sure 99% of the pease students feel the same way.
But now Tyler is living with me, so that's still fun!
So Bridget moved back into her house, which is a good and sad thing because I miss her living with me.
this school week should realistically be senior skip week
Pease seniors, is tomorrow senior skip day?
@ProblyDntLikeU lol eeewwwwww!
I've had three people live with me this year.
@shantymanty well then we have those everyday almost lol
It's Tyler's birthday!!! Love you babe :-)
Bridget is going to be gone all weekend :(
Tyler and I have too much of a habit of never leaving the bed when he's over.
@shantymanty when my school doesn't even have a senior skip day.....
And I am so glad I was on the team that made it so we got first place, it was so much fun!
Today was an amazing day. For the fourth year in a row now, PEASE has gotten first place in the volleyball championships.
And tomorrow I'm going to Recovery in the Park. Really excited to have a good time in the nice weather and to kick ass in volleyball.
Had my job interview at New Horizons and it went well.
I knew this day would come where I would be sad about that.
@_SamiBrandt just dm me or email me, sbrsi123@gmail.com
@_SamiBrandt well don't message me on facebook, can't log in without the code which is sent to my phone...
So today, I lost my phone in dinky town. So if you need to contact me send me a dm or message me on facebook...
Fuck this day and fuck everyone. I'm so done.
@zoenicolemuz hell yeah! text me and or @simonegatsby
@zoenicolemuz Miss you bunches! We gotta get together with our old Crystal group sometime soon.
9 more days of high school, boy oh boy did time seriously fly!
Bridget isn't even fully on the bed and she's ptfo Tyler and I were laughing so loud and it didn't even wake her up. http://t.co/mmD6KafzoA
@christymaee oh! I didn't either. Lol 
How ironic it is that we are having to take a survey about our experience with going to this school. haaaa ha...
@lannadelgay @mariearos @kardashiyanz y'all can dm me if you want
Kicking someone out just because you THINK they're using is not okay. That's totally fucked up. #FuckYouMike
But what about other nights.... That's what I worry about and wish someone would just be willing to let you stay with them.
I just want you to either be home or be staying at a stable place. And if that's my place for the night, that's fine.
I'm really getting tired of being pushed away
Mad Max was an intense and awesome movie. 
I have this issue with worrying about people. Even people who aren't in my life anymore...
I can't do anything right. I'm sorry!
@Healy_Lauren 
@Healy_Lauren okey hun
@Healy_Lauren uh
@kateashley_23 HOW 
There's something so comforting when wearing your boyfriends shirt to bed  http://t.co/qdiJblGWbn
Can't help but worry about Tyler tonight....
So glad you're out of my life.
This day ended on such a shitty note
The fact that Bridget and I are both not wanting to go to school is good enough reason to not go, right?
Wish I could be eating sushi right now, but have no money.
@RoseTheis1 I should be. But I'm not....
I've been procrastinating on cleaning my room for soooo long
@JJ_Ando excited af, but what if death????
Sorry for all the tweets about Tyler, I've just been with him for 4 days straight now. I love it though!!!!
It's so nice and easy sleeping next to Tyler. 
Tyler is the best thing in my life rn. 
@lannadelgay all that I was thinking when you said that was \"GET WRECKED!!!\"
@lannadelgay OH FUCK MEGAN!!!!
@lostxxlenore no
Tyler just tried to come into the bathroom with me when I was going to poop. 
My bed isn't the same w/o Tyler 
@kardashiyanz there was a dead bird right outside my front door today. It was gr8
Tongue pierced  ft babe  https://t.co/FNgdjD0Aff
It's done!!!  http://t.co/rx5Lf6viaI
It's spending my Friday's in bed with Tyler that makes me wish time could just stop forever. 
So stocked to get my tongue pierced with Bridget today!!! 
@MavisBjourtnis what the fuck?! If he does worse shit, he can go to jail for it.
@MavisBjourtnis that's a good idea.
@MavisBjourtnis fuck him up
He's my favorite, and my ass is his favorite  finnesegod74 https://t.co/K8PIWjLYQp
Props to babe for never letting my neck be w/o hickeys. 
@Jaimie2thick right.
I'm so irritated with so many people today.
Don't even feel bad for the people that will end up not graduating high school.
Bridget and Will are the cutest couple ever.  https://t.co/7wQ7yNbmP8
I'm so excited for Friday. 
Being able to spend the last three hours of school with Tyler everyday makes me so happy. 
Just chilling in my bathroom with Bridget and she's trying to pierce her eyebrow. Tis a fun night. 
So much anxiety it's making me sick.
I hate that I had to bring you home, I honestly just want to drive the 45 minutes back to get you so you have a place to sleep tonight.
I want to hold you here in my bed with me, making sure you're safe and okay.
@_SamiBrandt and verbally abusive
Sorry, but I was done and not going to be with someone who was emotionally and physically abusive to me anymore.
I'm happy and that's all that matters.
Please! If anyone knows of anyone that can pierce my tongue this week, let me know!!!
@christymaee yes, let's hope. Just stay positive and have hope.
@christymaee because if I didn't, I wouldn't be where I am today. It's tiring and annoying going through it, but it's worth it in the end.
@christymaee I know, I can understand that. I've been through 3 treatment centers this past year, but I'm glad I went.
Me too  https://t.co/KaRMgJb3Oc
Bridget is also living with me now, and I am just hoping all is going to go better for her. I hope she knows she can count on me. 
I can't even remember how my times I said I was happy today, and it's all because of Tyler and my best friends.
@christymaee it's not about the amount of times you go, but about the help that is given to you to help you grow
If I actually am able to get my tongue pierced with Bridget today, that'd be fantastic.
@AriLizDoyle seriously? What was she saying?
@AriLizDoyle what? Whoooo?
@MavisBjourtnis hello, good morning 
Craving sushi at 12:30 in the morning... Yep, this is my life. 
@afeyereisen favorite song
@lannadelgay 
I wish just thinking about food would magically make food appear in front of me. #LazyAndHungry
You're my favorite.  @ Vali Hi Drive In https://t.co/j1GArcaETa
It's now become so regular for me to be getting home or even being up past 4:00 a.m. every weekend
 https://t.co/jEhNY57etW
Love these guys  https://t.co/lTGReGlW5e
But now I'm awake, and waiting for the two losers to wake up.
Being at a hotel with my best friends was better than being at prom.
A hour into prom and I already need a cigarette and to jump off this boat
It's my aunt and my teachers birthday and it's Prom day 
I'm actually so scared for tomorrow
Stressing out because prom tomorrow
I'm not worth anything to anyone here.
I need to leave school. I've hit a wall and I can't hold myself together anymore.
I can't sleep 
Haven't gotten a back massage in so long.... This needs to change asap.
Still gotta get my nails done and get a tan ugh
Aaagghh prom is in less than two days!!!
Dude http://t.co/P9V8D2Qyiw
@1pumpdump #peaseyrbk
@Jaimie2thick just seeing you tweet about the fact that someone is joking about that makes me so angry
I'm torn between my mind telling me one thing and my heart telling me the opposite.
What the hell? I did not intend on taking a 5 hour nap.... 
For some reason I just want to go to the drive in tonight, just for one movie.
I just love when I lose friends and I don't even know why or what I did....
HAPPY 18th BIRTHDAY BRIDGET!!!!  I'm so happy of how close we have gotten and am so proud of how https://t.co/dV6dweRlJv
@_SamiBrandt it has to be in my graduation video *cough mom cough*
The song See You Again from Furious 7 will always make me tear up. 
Ugh, yes!!! Me too!!! I am stressing out so badly.  https://t.co/M3TT6nwKSd
@Jake2thick love you always
@AriLizDoyle chin up buttercup 
@lostxxlenore I have to go there
@lostxxlenore WHAT
@lostxxlenore 
The thought of losing you makes me sick to my stomach.... But I can suffer through the pain if I have to...
I wish Panera delivered.
Biggest pet peeve is having to repeat myself constantly because you can never listen or remember anything.
THIS HAIL IS THE SIZE OF GOLF BALLS
It was light when I came outside. And in the matter of 7 minutes it has gotten so dark. \n\nI just know a thunderstorm is coming.
I just love when the sky gets like this and I start to hear thunder http://t.co/vmXsWlrTrw

@AriLizDoyle congrats girl!!! 
@selenacmiell sometime next weekend after our prom.
@selenacmiell Bridget and I are probably gonna do it together. 
Really want to get my tongue pierced!
Missing you @Jake2thick  http://t.co/qczIIamNKP

@beccanbaker god fuck 
ONE WEEK! 
Meaning I can now go on Thursdays bc no school Fridays. Someone go with me!
The drive in is now open on weekdays. God bless.
Things are never going to get easier if you don't open up...
I wish I could make you happy....

Couldn't be happier to have this girl walk with me through recovery. Love seeing her everyday and https://t.co/AIHBZfcuDv
What am I doing falling asleep at 8... Why am I this tired...
This twitter drama is intense... But very much unnecessary. We are in high school, this should not be publicized on social media...
@Jake2thick bebs
It's speaking at schools and telling my story the reason why I am sober and staying sober.
Jake is the best guy ever. Still to this day he gives me butterflies in my stomach and it makes me so giddy. 
Two weekends in a row, this is my second home.  http://t.co/j2Sd10WrxB
@Jake2thick you're going to be the best one there baby. 
@Jake2thick you're going to be the best one there baby. 
@1pumpdump fuck yes. 27s are the best.
When can I be happy.... I can't handle this anymore.
Prom is in two weeks
@Healy_Lauren SO FUCKING TRUE
Going out without wearing makeup is nice sometimes. http://t.co/5vCMSpHtQw
So tomorrow I am speaking at a school about my story with addiction.... I'm so nervous... 
@christymaee they are hard to find sometimes, hopefully you'll have another chance soon!
@christymaee just look up restaurants or shops that have Bubble Tea.
Just posted a photo https://t.co/PEoxNNm69u
This has been a really hard month, I've never gotten this far in my sobriety and my urges were strong. But I made it to 4 months 
You're not worth me wasting my breath to speak to you.
4 months sober 
Trying to sleep when you have sharp pains in your stomach and your nauseous is so difficult. 
I'm counting down the days until I graduate. #42days
Bridget is just the cutest!  https://t.co/3GoEyYtDN1
@1pumpdump no. Because Rufus made me think it was only Friday.
@1pumpdump DUDE! I was supposed to come with you didn't tell me you were leaving :(

Not having school on Fridays is the best thing ever. 
Tyler just gave me a bloody nose by plugging my nose. That has happened to me twice now!! 
@Healy_Lauren we are both famous then! 
I'm so done with the guys at this school, I can't stand when they purposely do stupid shit and then get upset when they get in trouble.
Still feeling like shit because I'm sick, plus I've had a migraine all day and now I'm pretty sure I have an ear infection. COOOOLLL
I need sushi now. 
I'm so ready for prom and then it to be June.
Thankful that my mom is so understanding. 
I hate having my depression and anxiety keep me from going to school, but I already know I am not going tomorrow...
@_SamiBrandt @Jake2thick baby poopy paws
I need to get back into hanging out with friends. Because sitting at home and watching netflix is getting a bit old now.

Bad idea to watch the Nom Noms snapchat story when you're hungry 
When I get my hair bleached... My hair looks like fire http://t.co/MT3JNIyRuV
I've seen so many people post pictures of food, and I'm sitting here getting my hair done for the next few hours with my stomach growling..
@beccanbaker awww bebs  love you too, thanks for being there for me, especially this week. 
One good thing about being sick, having an excuse to be lazy and needy.
@kardashiyanz love you too mama 
I'm wanting to get another tattoo or piercing soon.
@kardashiyanz he well deserved it for the things he was calling you. You're a strong woman and you stood up for yourself (literally lol)
This week has just been.... Sigh... Very very rough.
I just want tomorrow to be Friday instead of Thursday. Bc 1 I get to sleep in, 2 I'm getting my hair done, and 3 I can just be lazy.
@wandxrlust_ it really is! But that place was not good for me, so I don't really feel bad.
No. This is not okay. Everybody needs to know to control their feelings and actions. This makes me mad.  https://t.co/vLjKNb2YXg
You're own health and wellbeing comes before anyone else's.

Let's see if my Tuesday will be better than my Monday. I don't have hope it will be, but I can only find out.
My morning jam consists of all Britney Spears songs. Brings me back to being a little girl again.
I'm sure if I go for a drive right now, even though it's after midnight, my parents would understand...
If any of my sober friends are awake right now and see this, I need to talk to someone... So please call 6124183848
....or well self control I think I have.
Oh how it's still so easy to get my hands on some sort of drug and use as much as I feel need to. But thankful for the self control I have.
I'm not sleeping tonight. Someone text me please.
Death sound so wonderful right now
@crystalizelissa don't even know what's going on, but I'm sending love and hope your way, darling. You're a strong girl. 
@shantymanty well tomorrow it'll be 108! Each day is getting closer. 
@shantymanty do you turn 18 in 109 days?
Throat hurts. Getting sick is my favorite.
@shantymanty I got mine, and it's probably one of my favorite piercings. 
I feel so disgusting. Probably getting sick. Yaaaaayyyy.... 
I want a tattoo of an anatomic heart
Happy Easter from the silly Brandt sisters.  http://t.co/PH1WUWSqta
But now I'm just grateful and proud of how far I've come, and that this year is nothing like last.
This time last year I was not able to celebrate Easter with my family due to being in the hospital.

Today marks my grandparents 51st Wedding Anniversary! Your love for each other all these years is amazing, inspiring and heartwarming! 
Pinterest is my new addiction.

Makes me sad when people's lives are prioritized to drink and use drugs. There is just SO much more you can be doing!
PROUD AND HAPPY TO SAY I HAVE FOUND MY PROM DRESS AND IT WAS UNDER $100 
All I want right now is a giant cinnamon roll
@beccanbaker first three are so me
@lannadelgay we must hang out someday. When Bruno is having people, I hope to see you sometime.
I go from wearing a dress yesterday to wearing complete workout attire today. Nbd.
@lannadelgay I miss you at school :(
Remind myself this everyday during my journey through recovery. http://t.co/1Yg7W39XEp
@kateashley_23 that's a total rip off!!! My hourly wage is $15 if it's more than two kids.
YES NOW ITS RAINING HELLA HARD
NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY TO SEE LIGHTNING AND TO HEAR THUNDER 
You know I hate you, why would you fucking sit next to me?
Wearing dresses makes me feel happy. 
I hope I don't wake up as yucky as I feel right now.
@joseuave same
Once a best friend, always a best friend.  Extremely blessed to have had you in my life the last https://t.co/RY5sRcfMjO
Today was an emotional but good day for me.
Hello, major back pain and bad headache is how my Tuesday is starting. 
Went to my first AA meeting tonight, and enjoyed it very much. The people were so kind and welcoming. I'm very glad I decided to go.

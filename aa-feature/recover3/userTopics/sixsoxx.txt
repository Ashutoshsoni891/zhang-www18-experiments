Now I'm getting paid to hangout
This guy randomly showed up at my work to clean the grill so I got to close early 
I can't stop watching American horror story but I have to go to work soon what do I do
Hi Matt

Done leaving bye
Reggies keeping me company
I'm sitting outside of matts locked out in the dark and a fucking cat walked up. Scariest thing
I'm sitting outside of matts locked out in the dark and a fucking cat walked up. Scariest thing
I need my own key seriously dude
Like how fucking scary would that be
As weird as this is, I think my biggest fear is being abducted by aliens
Also in desperate need of a better job
I think I need sleep
I have one thing on my mind but it's so big that it feels like a million things and I just wanna go cuddle up in bed
Matthew come to me
Alone in toms river w h a t where's matt

You can NOT handle the flow , son
Woah wiggity woah

This show is scaring the shit out of me but I can't stop watchiiiiing
Binge watching American horror story 
It's beautiful outside and I have no where to go. About to put in my headphones and go for a long walk
A little pampering for yourself doesn't hurt  http://t.co/ghNX98ptNR
Thinking about how I can really enjoy my day off today hmm
Most of today consisted of me sleeping and I loved every minute of it
I DONT HAVE WORK TOMORROW YES
HAHA poor Paulo
Today though is a whole other story but it's so worth it
Last night was so much fun and I can't wait to do it again
@anthemp2 I'm petting beavis 
I attended that school for 4 years I do not wanna be hearing them
Cherokee is so fucking loud my god
It is cold I am hyper and I am bored
If you're smart, you won't go to the bagel bin tomorrow
But work tomorrow. That's gonna be something else
Very super siked for tonight
@_titusmat @Siedlarz_ I just wanna dance man
Beware the scare of marry shaw. She had no children, only dolls. If you see her in your dreams, dont ever ever scream http://t.co/OFokJVMAvt
Selfie time  http://t.co/5DkEu8sdJo
Oh lord
Cuddles with the brotherrr http://t.co/ofsTBbdoPG
My brothers making a room full of traps for me to hurt myself on bc I tickled him . Over reacting dude I'm tellin ya
Brother sister niggght 
I have work in a half hour and my car keys are not at my house woops
I'm overthinking things probably but this is really getting to me
I'm done cleaning. I've had 5 customers all day. I still have an hour
And everything that was said has me thinking big time
I keep reading the same thing over and over again and making myself feel worse than I already do
Why can't I just go watch movies in bed
Now I have to clean another mess
Not only am I the only one here but now things are falling by themselves and that chipmunk last week . That was not ok
Seriously considering leaving this job bc I think it's haunted
Day one
Feeling sad and sick
Can I not go to work today
This is gonna be a sleepless night . Better pick out some movies
Gotta make more changes pronto
Just because you do something wrong doesn't give someone the right to treat you like you're worthless
Not saying I don't do it bc I do but it's just sad
It's sad how people have to resort to Twitter now to talk about their problems
Kicking me out of your house instead of facing the problem is not a good way to handle things
@_titusmat about what
Bzzzzz
The double buzz
Waddup matthew
Mooooooooovies 
Okay buh bye
A little sweetness would be nice once and a while ya know
I'm just craving to do something so super romantic that's all
That's my brother for ya http://t.co/6zvAvGw1In
Wanting z babe
I took my car in to fix the clicking sound and found out they have to fix pretty much everything on my car awesome
This car is costing me so much fucking money I should have just bought a new car seriously
That also goes for pretty much my entire 4 years of high school
Looking back at my tweets from May-June and realizing how shockingly stupid I was
I'm spending money that I don't even have and it's stressing my out v much so
Day 2 of fixing my car
Hi matt
Having 3 days off is nice and all but it kills my paycheck and I need the moneyyyyy
Matts dad said pasta now all I want is pasta
99% sure matts hooking up with his dog ok matt
Almost set my house on fire woooops
Can I just move out now
I want my car
Car is in the shopppp poor baby
But on the plus side it gave me an excuse to get a new, non cracked phone 
Went to my first party last night and 10 minutes in it got busted and I lost me phone
The most stressful thing about tonight is trying to decide what to where
I burnt like half my arm at work today and it didn't hurt untill I got home
Nothing to do so I'm sitting at the park swinging by myself bc I'm cool
Wat http://t.co/8Wfh3Kjxwl
I didn't mind being by myself at work at night at first but now it's kinda freaking me out
He's probably laughing at me somewhere
This chipmunk keeps popping up everywhere I swear he thinks it's funny
I have a cut that I just spilt bleach on ouch
A fucking chipmunk is running around my work rn what where did you come from
THEYRE PLAYING NIGHTMARE ON MY STREET ON THE RADIO TODAY IS GOOD
I finished cleaning the whole store and still no customers so may I please go home now
Okay we are a bagel shop. There is no reason to be open till 630. Who the fuck is gonna come get a bagel at 5 pm
At work and the radio is playing all throwbacks rn I'm jamming so hard
Later tater
Nada
What is there to do on a Wednesday afternoon in marlton
I just saw the funniest commercial ever I'm dying
Parents just don't understand. HA will smith
I just wanna go to ams house
I like fall bc it rains leaves
Suddenly feeling sick what do I do
So excited to sleeep but I must watch fresh prince first
This made me giggle http://t.co/CtWUntuHDK
Sitting in Barnes and nobles reading children books and I honestly couldn't be happier
Finally relaxingggg 
\"FUCK AUTO MEGA MUFFINS\" - Jacobs words of wisdom
Went to target with my little brother to buy a Tshirt and came out with 50 bucks worth of toys
So beat yet I'm still awake kill me
Waiting for da boyf to get done playing bball
Getting gas tonight was a blast and a half
@anthemp2 @_titusmat I'll be needing those yes thankyou v much
@_titusmat @anthemp2 hook me up with some corn stalks and I'll give ya a cow
@anthemp2 not me ok them*
@anthemp2 at least someone understands. Let's start me back up
@anthemp2 @_titusmat don't you agree though? We gotta get some trade routes up in here
@_titusmat my point. How would I know? Everyone's so tied up in money that we all forgot how much sheep are really worth
I'm exhaaauuussted
I'll take a pound of butter for 2 sheep
If we still traded instead of creating money then people wouldn't need jobs and I could be at home sleeping rn
Got to spend my morning with my 2 favorite boys
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Work went surprisingly well and only 10 more minutes 
Tonight's goooooooood and it's only 930 wow hello
Talking to the boss about firing me bc you THINK I stole money. People are fucking stupid
I drank too much fucking coffee and I am still going
It's crazy how much happiness one person can bring someone
How do you just call a bagel shop and ask if we sell bagels ..um yeah I think we do
630 could not come any sooner
I just got blocked by a huge fucking cricket I'm out
The fresh prince of bel air gives me such a good feeling inside that I can't explain
I'm already thinking about things to do during Christmas time I can't wait 
Mall trippp
Who wants to go to work for me
Matts so cute in the morning aw
Time to play at z park
JAKES HERE WOO
I'm waiting for jake to get done school so in the mean time I shall be watch the fresh price marathon
Excited for laterr and next week and Wednesday and that's all
I just hope you realize being your friend kkkiiillllsssss me
So unbelievably happy right now
\"I'm swinging with me nuts\" -Jacobs words of the day
Everytime I take jake out, people think he's my son and give me weird looks. I am not a teen mom I am sorry to break it to you
More quality time with the brobrooooo
Unless those guys come in again and start talking to me about \"my life of a teenage robot\"
I'm gonna die at work today I feel
Movie nigggght
Losing any motivation I have to do anything
What to do what to do
This right here is what I live for http://t.co/yphkopYSus
God I miss you
My brother makes me so incredibly happy
I have one person that I can't get off my mind and it's really taking a toll on me
\"Now I have some of your DNA in me\"
Spending time with my brother this weekend 
This is getting harder and harder
Bitch we close in a half hour you need to stop
There's this lady who came into my work and she's been staring at the wall in front of her for a good hour
It's weird but I actually don't ever wanna leave work
I'm actually kinda excited to take on life on my own for a bit. I havnt been on my own in a long time. I can take care of myself
If someone doesn't wanna try to make a relationship work, then it's not worth being upset over it
Currently sitting in my car in a parking lot at a car dealership
I'm trying to figure out how the hell to get through today on the little sleep I got
Beyond tired it's bed timeeeee
Officially starting to save up for my apartment 
I'm not mentally stable right now but I'm actually in some what of a good mood
Actually really excited to go home and pass out to my music
The universe is really testing me rn
I don't know how much more I can handle this week but let's find out it'll be like a game
If you're able to get over someone that fucking quick and act like you don't give 2 shits that you lost them, you never fucking cared at all
I wanna join a gym
Wow I actually lost almost everyone in my life and I don't know how to react to this
I love how I'm a slut and a hoe but I've been totally loyal. Bc that makes total sense
This was a huge wake up call. Time to make some changes
That up'd my mood tons
So I went to work only to find out it's my day off
I need a break today. I'm not doing this again
Cannot wait to get out of work and chilllll
I gotta staay hiiiiigh allllll the tiiiiime
Matt needs to come hooooome
Sorry for causing you stress?
I have off but have nothing to do . I'm going crazy
I have off but have nothing to do . I'm going crazy
I was excited to sleep in today since I'm off work but I woke up at 830
My bed is sounding more and more amazing as the night goes on
I'm going out with friends tonight finally and I can't fucking wait
So apparently I don't love you ok subtweets done
Jake just drank a bottle of Pepsi. The beast is about to be unleashed
I would kill for this kid. He's all I need http://t.co/sevKqlhsq4
I'm telling my 7 year old brother about my relationship problems and he's actually helping tremendously
I need a good stress reliever
Man that suuuucks
I didn't know I was capable of having so much disgust for one person
Too many boys .
\"What's up Perivian dick\"
I survived work today 
I look over at my brother to see what he's doing and he goes \"I'm trying to lick my nuts\"
I love guys who are major sweethearts but can be a dick when they want to
High how are you
You know I need somebody but you enjoy your movie 
This is why I have trust issues bc of the piece of shit I have for a mother
95% sure someone put a bomb in the backyard. The house might blow up before Matt gets home whaaaaat
Way to ditch me . Ya know it makes me feel real good thnx bb
\"Smoke kush eat yogurt\"
@_titusmat this made me giggle
Boy am I tired
Meet yellow jacket bc he thinks he's a bee. He's too high fo dis shit http://t.co/OZa89gV4Kb
We found a caterpillar and now he's a high caterpillar
Date day with da boyf
New York here we coooome
Dying z hair
I was doing so good
But I missed this feeling
I done fucked upppppp
We all know what I feel like doing tonight but that cannot happen
Since when are you guys friends what
I don't wanna be here but I have nothing else to do
Not all friends will last forever. Just gotta accept it and move on
@_titusmat are you ok
@_titusmat can I help you
I can never be a kid again and all I can do now is keep growing up and that's a really fucking scary thought
Now I'd give anything to have that back
I was so excited to grow up my whole life and turn 18 and I pretty much rushed my childhood
I need a second job so bad
Watching who wants to be a millionaire at work
I need someone to play with I'm bored
Finished cleaning at work so I turned it into an ice skating rink
New license plates and car is finally in my name  http://t.co/ruiTxrBVxa
@Imamyrose sorry
@Imamyrose I didn't tweet that
Kinda debating on going home
Holy shit that retweet was more than relevant
\"What a mild inconvenience\"
Matt just needs to come home he eases the stress. If you're stressed, talk to ma man
My tweets are either me complaining or completely stupid and nobody knows what I'm talking about. I probably shouldn't have a twitter
Now I come to find out I'm paying too much for car insurance. We need some progressive up in dis bitch
God dammit just get me out of new jersey
But then again I wasn't involved in the original situation so why should I be upset about problems I'm not fully involved in?
I'm still in a good mood but everybody's stressed and pissed off so I don't wanna show I'm in a good mood bc then ill feel bad
Have you ever blow dried your clothes because you didn't have time to let them dry in the dryer? I have
I got bored so I went to work to visit what's wrong with me
Just spun out in my car once again but this time I didn't hit anything 
All the times I rushed to your house and was there when you needed me, just showed me I gotta lookout for myself from now on
It bothers me how you can think someone's your friend and they stab you in the back
Wanna go for an L ride?
If I lose my best friend bc of a back stabbing piece of shit, I'm giving up on everything
It's too fucking early for this
I wish I lived at matts I love his family
2 weeks clean and it feels like a month
Party tonight ? Let's see how this ends stay tuned
\"Can little babies rage?\"
Without math, we are cavemen eating mud
@_titusmat nah
I havnt been to an AA meeting in like 5 days I should probably go
It's cold that is all
What
I'm confused on so many levels
I feel the need to go to work today but I'm off
Fuck everyone seriously I need a drink
Do you realize you're one of my triggers
This is one of the fucking triggers I have

Have you ever just sat and pondered life
@_titusmat wow you're really funny you should be a comedian
I work 5 or 6 days a week now and I can't tell if I like it or not
Work sucks I know
It's such a fantastic feeling to know that Cherokee starts back up tomorrow and I will not be attending it
Doode pasta
I'm only on day 2 and things are already starting to get better
This is gonna be a looooooooong journey
Going to my first AA meeting today

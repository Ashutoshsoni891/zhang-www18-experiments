THERE IS ACTUALLY NOTHING I HATE MORE THAN THE KINGSTON BUS SYSTEM
Taking the bus to the mall is literally a tour of Kingston #getmeoff #ihatebuses
Jesus take the wheel will never get old
All I wanna do is shop for the house #socute #nextyear #comesooner
That was a mental breakdown at its finest #ihateres
That sick life 
People spend way to much time worrying about other peoples lives that they do nothing with their own
Bed has never been so comfy #exhausted
Guys do it all the time

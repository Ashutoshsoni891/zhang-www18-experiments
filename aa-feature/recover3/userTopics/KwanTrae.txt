She is knocked out on my chest 
It's 5am &amp; I'm online tryna find sneakers , watching family therapy , &amp; wanting to be laid up.

I have 3 jobs and a hustle. Got way too many goals to only have one source of income.

New life. Who this?
Hustling!

This woman who lives downstairs fucking coocoo
Nap time like a mf
When I'm getting off work but she going in 
I hate pets. There, I said it.
&amp; doing laundry.
When something fun turns into something real 
Blame it on me , Say it's my fault
When someone wakes you out your sleep then you can't go back to sleep 
Thought I could do it alone until I relapsed. 
My first AA meeting was today... I still bought a bottle.

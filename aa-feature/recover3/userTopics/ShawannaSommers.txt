Been sitting in my car in front of the Ymca tweeting like I don't have tons of shit to do today!
You're such a vibrant thang.
So far I have given up alcohol, pot, chicken, pork and beef.  Feeling like a nun. A vibrant one tho.
Trying to wean myself off the substance.
Did you know sugar is just as addicting as cocaine??
Hi my name is ShawannaSommers and I am a sugar addict. #addiction
My camera is not working on my s7. No snaps for me.

Aware of my surroundings.
Less ruthless with it.
Sobriety has cleared my clouded mind.
Unready. Then ready. Unready again.

If anything you should be bending over backwards... not me.
Not feeling lifted. Not in the least bit.
Made ramen and spilled it.

I am not her anymore, tired, overworked, irritated, aggravated, isolated, dissipated. She is not me.

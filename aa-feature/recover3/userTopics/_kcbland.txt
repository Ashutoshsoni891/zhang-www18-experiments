So tired of being out of shape
Pizza rolls and mac n cheese all day every day
Why do I have to apologize at least 20 times a day on Roman's behalf
Why does my opening associate always fail to show up to work???
I live for naps
Why does Jason always keep it -55 degrees in our apartment
mac n cheese is just too good
Told my mom I wrecked my car &amp; she didn't believe me... I don't get it
I just wanna leave
&amp; wrecking my car is the perfect example of how my day is going
I wish work would die down for like 2 seconds just so I can get my life together gosh dang it
I can't wait until it's time to leave for work
So weak hearted and I hate it
I always catch myself getting mad about the smallest things and then I'm like "kc chill u actin like a lil bitch"
@Hug_able143 Yes
l m f a o my 2 weeks is about to be the most reckless/ruthless thing I've ever written. Idgaf about burning bridges

Nothin on but the radiooooooo
All I wanna do is watch prison break and eventually fall asleep
never been so happy to be awake this early in the morning
this has to be some kind of sick joke
Sometimes i just wanna be left alone, don't mean I'm mad at ya lmfao
Nothing worse than working inconsistent hours Tuesday-Sunday
So not excited about work this week at all
I could eat wings all day every day
Man this weather is too nice
I also have no problem with eating chocolate cake for breakfast so it is what it is
I can't believe I just got out of bed. I've been so lazy these past couple of days
@hi_its_jenni lol I love you but you know it's not the same
Hate sleeping alone so much
I want a pizza and cuddles and I can't have either so life isn't fair
Devoting my entire night to Prison Break and not mad about it
I suck at remembering things
I'm never on time to anything
Today is the perfect example of me always getting what I want
All I really want at the moment is Fazolis
Wish I could just leave things alone
Jaylyn always gets so mad at me when I don't put my seatbelt on
You know when you're sitting across the dinner table daring a bitch to look at you wrong
It happens
caring too much is becoming such a problem
I have my heater and my fan on... im confused... who let this happen
@vashappnin27 Kills me every time I think about it
I think "I don't get it" to myself at least 15 times a day
 https://t.co/Y0DkhS35ih
I've got some damn bad intentions
feels so great being genuinely happy
Every time I see some shit I don't like, I just sit back like "okay. aight. imma remember that"
I don't get it?????
I have such a love/hate relationship with my boss
Michael in Prison Break has the prettiest eyes I've ever seen
Ginuwine
I love bath bombs so so so much
@QueenMackenzie_ The vampire diaries, Jane the Virgin, Lost, Prison Break, and/or The Carrie Diaries

Really hope this week just flies by
so tired it's crazy &amp; today sucks
You know you're lost when you end up on chicken rd
Keegan is over here cracking mad jokes &amp; im tripping so hard  I can't handle it
Do yaself a favor and don't get caught up in the shit you can't have
Man I hate when people get too caught up
I'm too excited for Allie and I right now
Damn I fucked around and got lost
I get such a bad attitude when I'm tired but idc
Someone needs to tell my dad that just because he comes into my work doesn't mean I'll talk to him. We're not cool homie
Today is so hectic
Keegan is such a blessing
Gotta stop doing too much for people that wouldn't do a damn thing for me
livid
My boss is mad bc I got to work at 9:50 when I'm scheduled at 10????? Makes zero sense. How bout ya don't come to work on your day off???
I get what I want
Dying to know why the car in front of me is going 19 in a 40 and hitting their brakes every 20 seconds
Please tell me that Allie did not just refer to herself as a snow bunny
Alright I bought a new handbag today, it's a great day
@robjackson015
Bless up bc Keegan ordered City Barbecue for dinner  #happysister
I have to clean my apt today. I have to. No excuses or bullshit kc.
A Day To Remember is really doing it for me today
@iam_alxxiii__ me every morning with work lol
@Catt_187 proud of you tho lil mama
This morning was definitely one of those mornings that I didn't wanna get out of bed
I'm the kind of girl that will wanna see a scary movie, but will also have my face buried in my baby's arm the entire time
The Belko Experiment is frickin messed up
a little annoyed
Driving backroads, french braiding hair, and picking a song on Spotify all at once is not easy
Met Keegan at her hair salon after work bc I knew she'd take me to lunch. I love her
Appreciation post for @its_brittnaaay just because i missed ya so much. Love you lil mama  https://t.co/nRuEulBCuH
I damn near live to piss my parents off. Not intentional or anything, but mother fuckers ain't satisfied with anything
Taking the back roads home from work &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
I want a puppy so bad
Roman over here talking about how needs to cut hours &amp; im over here like "bro just take me off the schedule for this week."
Ya girl set the store alarm off twice this morning
I would be the one to forget my notes on how to open the store, looks like I'm winging it
John Wick over here really hitting me in the heart
Oh god my heart  https://t.co/nmyDfveVnO
Sometimes I get so caught up in things &amp; cant control my emotions lol

140 characters isn't enough for how many rolling eye emojis I want to tweet
I'm so tired
This has been the shittiest week
When am I ever gonna learn
Keegan said "HE WASNT READYYYYY" and I'm dead
 https://t.co/svJKoBKvBm
&amp; Jase knocked on my bedroom door and asked if I needed a hug  I love him
&amp; Jase knocked on my bedroom door and asked if I needed a hug  I love him
My heart melts every time Jason calls me his sister
Like I'm 18 &amp; a manager of a shoe store. I'm not trippin, fuck y'all
Idk what id do if I didn't have Keegan to talk to bc only she really knows how shitty our dad is, fuck em
It doesn't cost a damn thing to be a decent human being
so prepared to never talk to you again
lol why do I care so much
Finally washed my car
How am I at work right now
 https://t.co/a5st7ZKOt5

About damn time I clean my car
Happy Birthday lil shawty  I love you so so so so so much  @sadieanne17 https://t.co/OqaOVngC5g
Why did I just agree to come in on my day off
Its definitely time for a new job. Can't convince myself that I love it anymore.
SAME https://t.co/GMDWRUDfx3
I hate when my sister leaves our apt door unlocked bc i can't shake the feeling of someone being in there waiting to kill me lolololol
The only good thing about closing only to open the next day is that I can leave the store a wreck &amp; I don't have to answer to anyone but me
Doin 80 in a 60, fuck a ticket
Can't believe I used to stress so bad about the closing the store, I got it completely under control now lol
@ahmazingginger that's why I started working here in the first place  have to get that discount girl
My boss pretty much just told me to call him back when I get it together  ooooooookay that's fine homie
I've gotta stop trying on shoes while im at work for 2 reasons. 1. I get nothing done lol 2. I just fell in love with these burgundy heels
love love love T.I.
Some high schoolers really make the worst employees. Work doesn't have to be your first priority, but you can't let it affect other people.
I live for people like Jenni Cloe and T.Minnis  bless their souls
if I could forget any day happened, it would definitely be this one
 https://t.co/wujmtshAAA
Dave just shattered my heart into a million pieces
I don't tell @hi_its_jenni that i appreciate her enough. I LOVE YOU &amp; thanks so much for being so good to me. Idk what I did to deserve ya
Like wednesdays don't already suck enough
I have such a terrible headache
I hate not knowing what to do
My sister said "even tho I don't like u right now, I still love u &amp; it doesn't mean we're not sisters anymore &amp; I'll unblock your number."
Marie did not just call me at 9 in the morning talking about work
There's no way I'm gonna get all this stuff done before 10pm. I'm freaking out
Marie better thank God for me
Hey girl- Billy Currington
So blessed
My associates are so perfect, I love them

This freaking suuuuuuuuuuucks
If y'all wanna come to dsw, we're open til 8 tonight &amp; if you make a $25 dollar purchase, you get a backpack and water bottle &amp; 1000 pts
"I ain't sayin that I love her but this bitch is gonna drive me mad"
Knew I shouldn't have worn these stupid shoes
Someone needs to turn the heat on before I freeze to death at dsw
All I want is a pizza
Hopefully Roman can get on board with my ripped jeans &amp; my bad attitude bc he's stuck with it for 8 hours
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
Ugh I need to go home
When you're pissed and you don't know whether or not to let a nigga know you're mad or to be low key shitty
Fucked around and got drunk in broad daylight
If you know he's a fuckboy, then why screw with him? Can't raise a man boo
I'm the best motivator https://t.co/fibThb9qWJ
I saw one of my parent's neighbors for the first time in forever &amp; he said "baby girl you keep getting prettier and prettier every day"
I love meeting new people
@str8outofcomp lol I feel a little creeped out
How is it already 1am
I hate taking naps in the evening, but hell im about to
Never know how to feel when someone pokes me on Facebook...
I'm too stoked about having the next two days off work
Imma pop off to anyone that says "you better get on board with it" to me. Like mother fucker, don't tell me
Really don't want to go to work tomorrow, I hate Wednesday's
I'll go to the grocery store for a couple things &amp; end up spending over $100... HOW it's a grocery store
Keegan is such a doll
I would get a flat tire today, my luck is always on point
I hate when I get real tired at work bc I get a lil reckless and slightly disrespectful
"I think this is where you were supposed to pull in straight.... and you pulled in crooked."
Why do I ever tell Roman what I'm struggling with at work? His solution to everything is coming in hours early &amp; im not down with that
I appreciate Allie bc she sends me these texts that turn my entire day around and she doesn't even know it
Can't make everyone happy
Getting out of bed is nearly impossible today
Nothin changes
 https://t.co/HiUVnLcrb9
Cried bc my associates cheered me on about my promotion. They're so sweet, I love them all #blessed
Brand meetings always make me so inspired. Like come see me at dsw &amp; I swear i'll make you fall in love with the shoes you're wearing
Dave got the slow jamzzzz playin this mornin
It's only 8:40 in the morning. Someone please tell Roman its too early to catch an attitude with me
almost 3am and I just wanna be laid up forever
I have the kind of sister that makes me sit in the bathroom with her while she showers just to keep her company
I love my sister's mother in law
Culver's ice cream is about to be the bomb
In love with Happier by Ed Sheeran
@hi_its_jenni still no judgement lil shawty lolol
Just saw a girl roller skating down southport rd.... that's not normal, right?
I'm shitty. Steven put a pizza in the oven without a pan and I burnt myself trying to get it out
Screwed around and now I'm late for work
Zac Efron is such a hottie
The amount of studying and note taking I'm doing for work right now after working all day just completely sucks

How is Wednesday gonna be mine &amp; Keegan's day to hangout and she not even be home when I get off work??? I don't get it
I love John Michael Montgomery so much
He was excited too &amp; she knows how much he's feelin me. Why she gotta do him like that
Marie told the FedEx guys to call me, she's playin too much
Yooooooo Marie and I are gonna lose our jobs today, I just know it
Be with someone who can literally turn your entire day around
What happens when your sister comes to see you at work... lol https://t.co/U5LqgwwUIH
Sometimes you just gotta say "momma ain't raised no bitch" &amp; stick it to your boss
I'll just be honest, the best part of my day is when Jason leaves bc then I don't have to worry about be fully dressed 24/7
It's so hard to hold back from being petty when you're a real petty person
Damn I am so tired
Finally catching up on the following
Panera
Damn I haven't slept in like this in forever
when you know, you know &amp; I just know
Lmfao they always come back
So thankful for Tori and Rachel

Sometimes I watch videos of Allie and me that I didn't even know existed and just die laughing for at least 10 minutes
Roman already made someone cry, I don't get it
Leavin's so hard
She a bad bitch, all jokes aside
Damn little upset that I was misbehavin
it is what it is
@DontBri_ahater lmfao it's terrible
So tired
My maid of honor speech for Keegan was a complete disaster. I forgot how bad it was until I watched it in a video. I said DROP THE MIC
It doesn't get better than red velvet cake
"Kc looks so boujee" -@hi_its_jenni
I have zero interest in getting out of bed today
I'm the "baby come back to bed" kind of girl

I have suchhhhh a bad headache
Then he said "I'm also gonna need you to close tomorrow" ... NO ITS OKAY, I didn't have plans or anything.
Update: My boss didn't even let me clock in before giving me a list of things he wants me to get done today
I don't wanna get out of bed
Crazy how you can just lay in bed with someone and talk about everything at all hours of the night and not be tired
"Let me catch you followin some bitches"
t swizzle night
@eorr34_ever couldn't agree more

@eorr34_ever I heard that their commercials are gonna go on for another 5 years or something  Monica peck and Courtney Cole forever...
He say I'm reckless, he probably right
Every time Keegan comes home from work, she'll walk straight into my room, show me her outfit, and tell me she missed me. Never fails
"I need to make my bed" "Don't bother"
Call me crazy, but I love Joe Carroll
Sometimes I ask myself should I just sit here or should I do something about it

"Go on baby, hurt me tonight. I want ours to be an endless song, baby in my eyes you do no wrong."
"You don't want me baby, please don't lie. But if you're leaving, I gotta know why."

The fedex guys at work just don't stop
Sometimes when your parents slide into your messages, you gotta "new phone who dis" em
I'm never on time or early so that leaves one other option
Keegan didn't go into work today so I really need a good reason why I should
I always fail to sleep when I should
"You got low standards""I know, i like you"
Your mcm actin like a foooool on the court
Lmfao so stressed
All I want is a nap

someone needs to tell my dad that money doesn't buy happiness
Ain't no rest for the wicked

Don't be acting like I need you
Hate when I accidentally favorite stuff
So my sister just told me that for the last 3 nights, she's dreamt that I died. &amp; last night she was crying and tried to call me at 4am
I slept real good last night so I have no clue why I'm this tired at 8:30... I don't get it
When my ex is on my "who to follow" I'm like oh hell fuck outta here with that shit
@Tim_RigginsJr had to show my love somehow yk
Oh hell yeah I did https://t.co/O5W7xENubN
Why am I so damn irresponsible
GAAAAAAY BITCH https://t.co/bNZ6xwM0ur
Every time I see jay, I'm like THATS MY BEST FRIEND and we're about to fuck shit up
My parents new neighbor said "so happy to finally meet the youngest. Your parents told me you're the crazy one" Idk how to feel bout that
My dad cracks me up talking financials, I'm laughing so hard
I wish my dad knew how much I appreciate him bc he's already done so much for me &amp; he never stops til I'm at my happiest
Dad and I left the car lot &amp; somehow we're back at the car lot...
Spending the day with my dad &amp; so happy about it!!
Living with your sister means having her crawl into bed with you at all hours of the morning  https://t.co/Cd4M38g3DH
Sometimes I just gotta remind Jenni Cloe that she's Jenni fucking Cloe and she's got this  love u biotch  @hi_its_jenni
So grateful for how things are working out this week
I seriously love oatmeal
I've been tossin and turnin so much lately. So restless
I just really don't get some people
I love keegan felicia
Keegan's asleep when I get home but Im laying in bed and she yells my name so I go runnin to her room and all she says is "goodnight love u"
words can't even explain how tired I am
@hi_its_jenni that's why you're the best, Jenni Cloe
I hate being all comfortable in bed just to not be able to remember whether or not I locked the apt door
I hate feeling underappreciated and then to have someone else get and take cred for something I did has me sooooooo messed up
Keegan is the biggest distraction when I'm trying to get ready for work
Wish other managers understood that if you respect your associates &amp; build a relationship w/ them, they will respect you   Never fails
Got me up all night, constant drinking and love songs
If it's during the week, I don't want to hangout. And if it's the weekend, I probably still don't want to hang out
I'll probably punch this McDonald's drive thru worker next time he flirts with me. Leave me alone lil homie and make my coke
Just now rememberin that Keegan woke me up at 6am this morning just to ask me if her shoes went with her outfit...living with her is greattt
Today has been way too stressful
"Kc you look so cute, I didn't even recognize you" uhhhhhhhh?????
Update: my ex best friend's mom snapped me back, it's all good
My ex best friends mom added me on snap, screenshotted my snap and didn't snap back.. don't know how to feel bout it
@ahmazingginger yes!
@ahmazingginger dsw shoes!
The song Headband will never get old &amp; I think of @Hug_able143 every time I hear it
"She a bad bitch, all jokes aside"
Maddi told me I'm the only reason she's staying at our job bc I'm her favorite manager  I looooooove my associates
How did I forget about Skillet
Was about to get out the car but then crush crush crush by paramore came on &amp; I was like hellllllll yeah what's up brb jammin
Wish I could fall back asleep bc I have work in a couple hours
I can't stress enough that you should always do what makes you happy, but if you're being fake in the process... I'm conflicted
Feel like I haven't been home in forever
When your migraine won't go away, you've taken too much medicine, nothing helps, you can't sleep, and showers make you nauseous #GoMe!!!!
Oh my gosh I'm so sick
I was seriously blessed with the best parents
Thankful for my mom who will still rush home to take care of me. Still her little girl &amp; I love her
I hate that feeling you get when you know you're about to throw up
I just wish this migraine would go away
@Jack_jackk03 right on jacks
Blue Crush is one of my all time favorite movies
Sometimes you gotta let people know that they ain't seen crazy yet
@hi_its_jenni SAMESIES

I love Sadie Butler so much
@hi_its_jenni THANK YOU BABY LOVE U
Update: Alec really did come over and body slam me into my bed. His shoulder blade hurt so bad but it's whatever

That tweet doesn't apply to you. I appreciate the hell outta you https://t.co/TuQL0rXwB3
@Tim_RigginsJr I mean what's up lil homie
Senior night for Perry wrestling is getting intense
Lmfao why do I ever think I can count on anyone but myself
Do not want to go to this meeting at 8am
Sometimes I wish Lex knew how much I miss her
Chances are anything people have kept hidden from me, I know &amp; I just dont say anything. &amp; ik I'm the better friend bc I'd never do it to u
Never again will I get so caught up in something that takes my heart months to heal
I hate when people take things the wrong away &amp; then they're set on it not meaning anything else. Like idc get your feelings hurt, fine w me
My dad called me and asked if I wanted his Dodge Challenger so he can buy a new Jeep w/o my mom getting mad at him...what is wrong w/ him???
I moved into my apartment a couple months ago and my bedroom is finally how I want it, Amen to being A1
How hard is it really tho to empty out the dryer &amp; to put your shoes in the coat closet and to not leave stuff laying around...
Life would be soooooooo great if I wasn't picking up after Keegan and Jason all the time
Not the biggest fan of getting off at 9:30pm just to go back at 8am
Heaven is a place on earth with you, tell me all the things you wanna do
Training a new girl at work &amp; she went on lunch w/ me so I asked her what kind of music she listens to and she likes Lana Del Rey #YASBITCH
Hell yeah the soska sisters retweeted me. Such evil genius masterminds
If only I was tired bc I'm still awake and I have to work in the morning
Should've just stayed in bed
I hate when unknown numbers call me &amp; they're like "who this" cause I'm like "uh no you called me so who's this?"
I love the soska sisters, bless their souls
So stoked that season 2 of Hellevator is on Netflix
Taylor Minnis is such a blessing
3am and Keegan comes in my room and crawls into bed with me. God I love her
My dad takes new cars to the extreme
You let Keegan spend all day with my parents and she comes home with a new Jeep... #ImpulsiveShoppers
omg I miss xc so much!!! https://t.co/Zs2iIGxQTs
Stoked for my first AA meeting today

Whenever I drink alone I get too into my feels.
finally made up my mind for once...
Molly needs to learn to keep her dumb inappropriate comments to herself
I actually have the night off, I don't even know what to do 
it is Monday @  https://t.co/yPk078Ut9M
And the Nanny life begins 
I'll be okay, just not today 
Happy Father's Day thanks for always making me laugh. @ Veritas Winery https://t.co/0GQzE1FRd0
@haleyholmlund HAPPY BIRTHDAY HAY wish I could be in CA with you to celebrate! Miss you so much! Love ya http://t.co/KLeG57EaZx
The Boy Next Door is soooooooooo good
Need cuddles
Lowkey hate my blonde hair.
I don't have to work again until Thursday
I have an extra ticket to Starry Nights at veritas tonight if anyone wants something fun to do, let me know! 
Everything hurts
Today was one of my favorite adventures https://t.co/DAAoFt972g
3:30 needs to come faster! It's too hard to see the sun shining and be stuck in Target
Be with someone that knows what they have when they have you.
Hanging out at Molly's house, without Molly, is probably the most depressing thing I've ever had to do.
Puppies and converses  https://t.co/RnmrTNbm35
@loggg_01  can't handle me. I'll be there tomorrow 7am sharpp
I need a back rub 
Proof that Molly trusts me: she just gave me the key to her house to stay there for the weekend and take care of her puppy all by myself.
Happy Birthday @loggg_01  hope you've had a good one!
Only the ones who truly care about you can hear you when you're quiet..
I was made for sunny days #nf #sweetsummertime https://t.co/7T0CFCFlgP
Whoa. It's late
I could listen to Slow Motion on repeat for the rest of my life 
Goodnight
@IAmMollaaay hey what's up hello
nobody ever wants to hang out with me
if work would let me work every single day, I would. Cause I can't stand being home alone with nothing to do.
my favorite girls http://t.co/N9xqG0OLFa
I wish I was tired
I'd rather sit in bed and drink an entire bottle of wine by myself than have a social life.
Target needs to realize it's actually impossible to manage all of soft-lines by myself for an entire night #toomanyclothes

@AliciaEng happy birthday pretty girl! Live it up
I'm so over working at Target.
Just walked in my room and balled my eyes out because today was that kinda day 
My back hurts so bad I would pay someone one million dollars to rub it
I just want to feel that I'm important to someone.
Being at work knowing I won't see @Conrad_LOE while I'm here sucks 
so much to say
Should I treat myself to Birkenstocks or Jack Rogers?! I can't decide.
someone please come over and just hold me
Lake day 
Thanks for always being in my space guys. And thanks becs for grabbin my boobs with confidence. https://t.co/5tZRByMzZM

can't stress enough how lucky I am to go to school so close to SML. Talk about a stress reliever 
when you're so confused that you just don't know how you feel anymore
it's crazy how a hug or cuddles can instantly change my mood. Like the feeling of being held is so satisfying.
never care too much about anyone that lets you go to bed upset
nobody said it was easy.
Today was the last day of classes, I took a bomb ass nap, and it's warm out  so I took a selfie http://t.co/voTEjzyV0q
Lack of consistency brings on lack of interest
stressed would be the biggest understatement
I want you to know that it's our time, you and me bleed the same light.
currently on the search for someone to come to Florida with me on the 28th for about a week, any volunteers?
@tha_0ww I can't wait to see how beautiful Ava is congratulations!!!
@eric_r_fletcher how thoughtful in desperate need of quality time with King Thomas soon?!?
I've never craved to be hugged so bad. Someone just hug me.
I know for a fact I would sleep ten times better every night if I had someone to cuddle up with.
I'm burnt and it hurts and I love it
today was the perfect reminder that I'm way too blessed to be stressed #SMLlife @ Smith Mountain Lake https://t.co/9Td6wOcPW0
Everyone take a moment to admire how white my bff becs is http://t.co/MakBBozpMx

After this extremely stressful and long week I'm way too excited for a day of complete relaxation tomorrow 
@elisescheeren yeah, sleep on the beach all day 
@SethHoo19 NEVER
HELP: get up for beach at 6am drive 4 hours for 75 and partly cloudy OR get up at 10 drive 45 minutes to SML for partly cloudy and 82?! 
Happy Birthday to one of my favorites @Spangler18 enjoy your day! Love and miss ya bunches
Not even tired
I'll be the first to admit I'm in total bitch mode tonight
It's better to have nobody than somebody who is half there
If you can't be kind, be quiet

@amanda_bgap haha it is seriously a struggle!
Easter dress shopping is so hard for me cause Easter colors are pastel and bright and I'm just more of a black and neutral girl.
Nothing gets by me 
Here is my nightly complaint about how I never have anyone to talk to late at night.
Only two more nights till I can feel the comfort of my own bed again 
Today, April 1st, the day all gullible people DESPISE 
Missing my twin brother something extra today @KingKanney

I don't know what I want. Ever.
only two things in our fridge are strawbarritas and cookie dough. Are we doing college right yet?
@elisescheeren hahaha for the better of course
For those of you that know I am FAR from a morning person, I just scheduled all my classes to be done by 10am next semester 
grumpy. just grumpy.
Lol I hate when I creep and see something and it just puts me in a bad mood.... 
Wow what a turn off....
Have you ever even lived if you haven't had an ocean water from sonic??

absolutely nothing feels better than the moment you put your feet up after wearing heels out
Has anyone else ever heard of Jell-O shot orange slices?!?
Need someone as spontaneous as I am in my life ASAP

Bored and far from tired.
I never have anyone to talk to late at night

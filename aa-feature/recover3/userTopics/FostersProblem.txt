Sometimes, going with the flow is the best decision you can make when you have no plans.
Comparing the Williams Sisters again the Manning Brothers is kinda insulting. The Williams Sister's legacy easily trumps the Manning.

It's okay to feel that you don't belong, and acknowledge that feeling. It's not okay to feel like you need to belong.
I'm so hype for this 2000's Dance party on Saturday! I'm so glad I rediscovered my passion for dancing and acting a fool on the dance floor

I love writing letters and having good face to face or voice to voice conversations, they're dying art forms in this digital age
It's something so authentic and intimate about having a conversation with someone without typing shit and using emojis. It's an art
I hate the pickup line, "can I text you sometime?" Nahh lemme call you when you're free. I wanna hear your voice, emotion, how was your day?

@LauRenxExCarter given the events of chaos, madness, and overcrowding in my city right now, I'm pretty great lol how are u?
NO MEANS NO FELLAS! There is no reason at all a woman should be harassed, ridiculed, assaulted, raped, or killed because she's not into you.
Randomly fucking up stores takes away from the whole purpose of whatever it is you're fighting for, now it just looks savage and spiteful.
Fucking up Starbucks like the Macchiato ever done shit to yall...man y'all ain't shit lol
Take that same fire and fury up to Capitol Hill, go against the system you hate and take action there if you're so ballsy, not the stores.
I'm all for protests n shit, but smashing up places where innocent people, like you and I work isn't progressing shit, it just looks foolish
@iiBreakNecks @TimiaTooTrill see that's what I don't get, how is smashin up a place where people work gonna help with anything? this is dumb
@Jim42Smith @unsuckdcmetro bruh I am so glad I got a weekly pass, I'm trudging right along lol

Tomorrow we will have a white president for the first time in 8 whole years...fuck man...
The world will keep spinning, but this election has really made me question where we stand as a people and doubt humanity as a whole.
I like my vegetables to be actual fuckin vegetables, I don't like salt or butter or grease on my shits.
I just don't get it, why? This feels like the ultimate betrayal, and there's not ONE MLK quote that you can post that'll change that.
The only conversation that your performance is gonna open up is the confused white people in the audience asking "who's the black girl?"
You can't build a bridge with ignorance and assume that 15 minutes of fame is gonna open up a conversation...
The media is referring to you as another Do D-list celeb in the lineup, but in our community your talent is A-list quality...why?
I know it's HER choice to perform for this crooked demon of a man, but why? His entire being goes against everything you ever sang about...
How Chrisette just gonna pull a Stacey Dash on us though?
@LawanVanida that's me down to the science. I take a walk thru Georgetown to Dupont every Friday night lol
I'm def gonna swing by Stachowski's Market next Friday and pick up some delicious lookin cuts of steak, I've been craving one so bad lately.

That was back in 2008 when T-Pain, Ye and Weezy made it THE THING to do
I felt that conscious rappers don't use auto tune.
We split because we all had different views on auto tune, they loved it and I hated it.
We were a dope ass group though, Mic-K, TB it was lit we lived music, where'd it all go?
I remember back when I was Problem-C aka Tha Local MC Haha
My the planets of my minds universe are starting to align again, my brain's beginning to shine again, I'm starting to rhyme again...
WE ARE NOT OUR FUCKING GRANDPARENTS! WE WILL NOT TURN THE OTHER CHEEK! WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THE BULLSHIT!
I want everyone of the racists coming to DC thinking that they're gonna occupy our city and be bold with their words to remember...
@Addicted2ginger can I sing a song?
And I apologize to any woman that I was ever friends with and ultra nice to just to try and get in their pants, I too was a creep before.
The friend zone is creepy, she doesn't owe you shit. Fuck your hidden agenda, stop being a pretender, is they why you befriended her?

And if you are doing it to show the Internet what a "good person" you are then that's who you should be 24/7, 365, 366 in the leap year
@EriselCruz feel me tho?! It's not that hard
Help people from the goodness of your heart
Being a good and decent human being means doing the right thing without looking for a some sort of approval from society or pat on the back
I hate seeing people post pix and tweets about helping the homeless for likes and rounds of applause; that's what you're suppose to do

@xLawanV when are u performing in February?
I don't wanna be the chaser, never have been, but that's not my style lol
I'm far to anxious and nervous to approach women in social settings unless it's through a friend or I get an opportunity to speak to em
I'm just hanging in, watching Bloodline and enjoying my own company
I'm so happy to see the snow and know that I don't really have anywhere I need to be lol

K Foos is the greatest man, thanks!!!
Got my home group meeting tonight, then afterwards a concert at the 930 Club to see Lettuce and TAUQ!!! I'm lit!!!
Saw my psychiatrist this morning and she was happy to hear of my progress and how hard I've been reppin her and the hood lol
If those are the worst things to happen to me today then I'm not having that bad of a day after all
Nope I'm still all good, smile on my face, hope in my heart; Ripped pants, busted headphones n all lol
You would think I'm having a bad day: 1st the left side of my headphones go out, then I ripped my pants at the meeting this morning...
Understanding rather than being understood. Listening rather than wanting to be heard, and giving rather than taking.
I'm gonna enjoy this year a clear headed and stress free dude, doing what I've been doing since I clean the last 5 months.
Progress not perfection people
I want a better me this year, but shit, that's something I should strive for everyday. Why live if not to progress each day of my life?
I want my friends to continue to grow and teach me of success and love through actions so I can become a better me
All I want to leave in 2016 is fear, loneliness, hopelessness, and depression.
I'm not for cutting people off just because a new year rolled around. The people I needed last year were there for me thru everything
No new friends, because my current friends are dope.
I'm not for the lame cliches for what I planned to leave in 2016. I don't want a new me, because I'm dope.
I am starting to feel like the person I was before my father passed back in 2002. I'm starting to get that sense of energy and self back
@xLawanV all of the racists are gonna come out of the woodwork and the circus will be in town lmao
@KingLouie8th it is so damn random but it's so honest and hilarious and pure lol
@iAmDrugzz Bloodline is pretty cool, I love the family drama and the suspense is cool

@LauRenxExCarter I love you Ren, like forreal!!!
But hey, at least I tried to do the right thing
I gave the Humane Society my contact info to let me know if they rescued the little dude, but I'm not sure if that'll be a good or bad thing
I'd hate to come home tomorrow and see that little dude all smashed into Michigan Ave lmao
I gotta get to work n shit, I just wanted to know that somebody could come and make sure this little raccoon doesn't end up as roadkill
Then the lady asked if I could trap it until a rescue crew came, I was like: https://t.co/fHTqdiZJyZ
"We actually just put them down when they come in" at that point I don't know if I helped the little fucker out or put their life in danger
So once I got through to somebody and told em about this limping baby raccoon, they said, "well we don't really rescue raccoons..."
So I Googled the number for the Humane Society in DC
The damn thing did start walking towards me, but I couldn't help but notice it's painful and awkward limp.
At first I thought it was gonna start chasing me or some shit...
My nigga instincts immediately kicked in and I got out of its path and went all the way around it, then the damn thing noticed me
So I was on my way to the station tonight before work, passing by Trinity U n shit, and I see this baby raccoon in the grass in front of me
#HTTR LET'S MAKE THE PLAYOFFS TODAY!!! https://t.co/ULxBztTGak

Waking up in @nashbegosh's place with the whole squad is exactly how I want to start off the last Saturday of this year.
I wanna finally travel this year too, the DMV is not my whole world. My personality is too big to be confined to one area.
The only thing I'm really looking forward to in 2017 is more opportunities for success, more growth, and serenity
@LauRenxExCarter oh hush!!! Lolz
I miss shorty so much, I hope she's getting the most out of her program and really trying at it this time around.
#In2016 I fell in love with someone without sexual contact
#In2016 I started holding myself accountable for my role in things, rather than blame others for my problems.
#In2016 I got comfortable with being uncomfortable and embraced changed rather than hide from it.
#In2016 I humbled myself to an exponential degree
#In2016 I found out that I don't need alcohol and drugs to have a good time or suppress my feelings, I'm actually pretty dope
#In2016 I found my inner child again, and let me tell you, I haven't felt this alive since 2002, when my father died.
#In2016 I found out the ones who are really there for me and the people who I don't need around anymore, but still have love for.
#In2016 I found out that I suffer from the disease of addiction, and instead of letting it consume me and quitting, I did something about it
2016 was shitty, pop culture wise, but for me it was an awesome journey.
I love my friends, they're so fucking awesome, so supportive, and so lit to life it's incredible!

@exotic_blaze I felt like 12 of em!!! Lol https://t.co/FbbztiXYUz
...and I cared about the drugs than myself
That was quite a luxury to have over the last few years, but not once was my longterm health discussed. The doc cared about $$$ not me
Def gotta get a primary doctor this year, I need more than just a person who will write me scripts for whatever drugs I want.
And 2001! https://t.co/i4nCnX9RpA
My dome is gleaming like a muuhfucka lmao

I'm kinda glad I won't have to sit thru another Kanye tour this year, I can't imagine cheering for this nigga at all right now
Lost my father, tried my hardest to find myself in a confusing world, used drugs and alcohol to escape reality, I get that niggas music bro
@MD_Law_Diva @Capone_Cutie is that what you're gonna be doing? I might cave and go to one of the AA/NA NYE Balls lol
When I say I bang with @KidCudi's music because it touches my soul and resonates so much with my life experiences, I mean it from my heart!
TDE doesn't disappoint, ever.
I love the barbershop. It's standup comedy, conscious conversation, relationship advice, sports trash talk, and Black unity all in one trip.
This is gonna be my first sober NYE in a long time. Idk what I'm gonna do...fuck.
I'm kinda sad because my shorty almost died, again. But in that same breath I'm happy that she's changed her location and got back to rehab
I don't talk about my sobriety to gloat, I do it because I'm still in awe at this fucking miracle and second chance I got. #GodsGrace
Blaming people for my issues, my shortcomings, and unhappiness got boring. Digging into my soul and finding my part in everything is dope
Damn Steve Francis you were one of people who made me proud to be from Silver Spring...hope he finds sobriety and his way eventually.
No time for hibernation, only elation.
@MalCUMXXX shit made me extra provocative in my approach to women. I became a savage in two weeks on my couch lmqo

God gimme the scrength
It's taking every fucking fiber in my body and soul to not unleash this gust of a fart I'm holding back on the train right now
@MalCUMXXX this is why the  pharmaceutical industry invented the beautiful concoction known as CODEINE for fiends like me lol
@coolminnie16 the crazy shit I did for love back then lol
I ALWAYS PLAYED THE VICTIM, UNTIL I WAS REALLY THE FUCKING VICTIM
I wore being depressed as a crown and allowed my anxiety to gain sympathy from people I didn't deserve it from.
I've been an ass to my family
I got circumcised at the age of 20 to please my girlfriend at the time because she didn't like little extra skin on the Wang.
I've driven drunk and put the lives of my passengers and other drivers in danger just to show I was good at driving drunk
I've finger-fucked my bank account and said fuck credit on many occasions
I've tried to turn a cold shoulder to women, then ran back like a bitch once I realized what I was pushing away
I've tossed up my middle fingers to work
In my alcoholism and addiction, I've done countless things to be accepted in certain situations.
Let go of your resentments. It's like peeing on yourself in public, nobody knows it but you lmao
I'm headed off to La La Land to count some sheep.
@terrafluu_ unless Trading Places by Usher was on, that nigga should've jumped out the car the sec yall pulled up. Guess I raised different?

People who blame rape victims for getting raped are the same ones who will walk in you on the bathroom and blame u for not locking the door.
Rehab Reds is it a name or a part of the game? The highlight of my summer, my burning flame in summers sticky rain.
But my Rehab Reds make me feel so connected to the one I care about the most.
Def tryna kick the cig smoking this week though, I want a 100% healthy year this year.
Pretty soon the NFL is gonna make players dress in the Michelin Man foam to prevent injuries. #dudesdroppinglikeflies
Everyday is a day to make a gratitude list man, not just for the tangible but for the spiritual shit.
This is the first time in a loooong time that I've been excited for the holiday season, and it's all because of Princess Lola
That's all I want for Christmas, sanity and peace. Oh yea, and for my niece to enjoy her 1st Christmas.
My five months of sobriety comes on Christmas day, that's dope as fuck! The gift of life reincarnated in the form of my recovery.
You can't compare your beginning to someone else's middle
I feel sorry for Ye, I hope he finds his way sooner than later.
Sit down and talk with someone, if you can, find a therapist. Ain't nothing wrong with sitting down and talking about your pain with someoen

I can't be out here living all comfortable knowing someone I love and care about is out here hungry and struggling.
I'm not afraid of any hood, or any gang. My mind is the most dangerous neighborhood I know of.

If you're famous and let that money change your minds idea of what your skin color is, I can't support you.
I felt that fire and it was like, "hold on nigga, I'm about to make your young ass feel real old right quick!"
My God has a funny sense of humor, hit me with a mean dose of heartburn yesterday before I went to bed before work lmao
And it's crazy because this time next week, I'll be 4 months clean and sober!

That's my open invitation to everybody! I just want to be around food and friends tonight, that's all.

It feels so good working 16 hours, falling asleep, and waking up to a Skins win! #HTTR!!!!
I just wanna be around some friends and good food, that's about it.
I have no idea what I'm doing for my birthday on Friday, and that's fine with me. I don't need a huge momentous occasion to celebrate life
Life ain't so bad
Take a moment out of the day to make a gratitude list for yourself just to remind you that there is always something to be grateful about.
I've survived 100% of my worst days, I'm not doing bad at all.
Saturday 16 today. I need strength!
Bruh what is this world coming to?! A baby drop-off?! Wtf?!
#FuckTrump bro
Marched in my first protest tonight down H street to 395, I've never been more proud of our diversity, never been more proud of the DMV

So imma get thru this shift, accept the fuxtaposition our country just put itself in, pray for a better tomorrow, and watch Gotham.
@LauRenxExCarter yep uggh
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous. It's like that sometimes the shit ridiculous. It's like that sometimes, ridiculous
I'll be so happy when all of this is over...
Even if you don't agree or don't think that your vote counts, make it count for someone you know that wishes they could vote but can't.
...and tear families apart due to his own insecurities and racist beliefs. Not today #ivoted
...and I would hate to even fathom the idea that some idiot could potentially intrude upon their pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness
My vote today was for those can't vote but wish they had this opportunity. I have many friends whose parents still aren't citizens...
#iVoted https://t.co/xNnM6aZpzS
I'm just tryna go 3-0 in voting tomorrow, that's all I know.
@MD_Law_Diva heyy!!!! I've been all cool. How about yourself??

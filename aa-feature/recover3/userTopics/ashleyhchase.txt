On the verge of crying, @bstallworths, don't leave me!! 
@JohnLClark best decision you will ever make!
@DainaChase: How cute is he? https://t.co/C5MOHqK9gI Dats my puppy!!
Watched a guy move his stuff out on rollerblades. I'm still confused as to why?
Last 2 Broke Girls night with Bailey for three months 
24 hours, 7 days a week, 60 seconds and a minute and time won't let me be and I just want to drift away.
So... can my professors just decide to cancel finals... like now?
\"Next year I will bike over every day, just to give you your daily dose of attitude\" - @bstallworths. Such a good friend 
@FunnyPicsDepot: Sloth has finally chilled... http://t.co/ISnghKOlmS @SeanHooper2
1 final down, 4 to go 
Living life up in the library on a Friday night... #finalsprobs
I kind of wish I was going home for the summer, but at the same time I can't imagine a better way to spend it than in Charleston.
My suitemate thinks Burger King is better than Taco Bell! I always knew there was something super weird about her...
I like how @bstallworths can't give me a compliment without throwing an insult in it.
Lobster status.
I'm watching this documentary that makes absolutely no sense because I'm that good of a suitemate  @bstallworths
@bstallworths: Well fuck. Life should definitely have an 'I was drunk can we all completely forget that now' button life story!
@BLFender22 ew stop! But city bistro is having bacon day/week or something!
But I mean what student wouldn't want an ice cream sandwich with candy bacon in it....?
Last class of freshman year. It is crazy how time flies.
Dear Lord, give me the strength to make it through these 3 tests today!
My life is a serious mess right now. I need summer 
Excited to watch my high school team play tonight! #GoodLuckLadies @NHSTrojanSB
@julianamarieh 4 shoo. 4 real though, We are done with that class 4ever. Thankful 4 that!
@julianamarieh ..and we ask ourselves what's wrong with us 
@julianamarieh same thing just happened to me. Mine was more like saying hey after he had passed... 
Bailey is the definition of a diva when she's sick. 
@ShtNo1SaysCofC: The nicer it is outside the more likely I am to go to class @julianamarieh
So I don't know what's more boring: this class or the conversations people have in here.
7 test in the next week, 12 test until summer... #bringiton
Describing last night as embarrassing is an understatement.
Harbor sixths fest!!!
Put a blanket on, you baby! #3against1 #thermostatwar
@SeanHooper2 http://t.co/tjTn7dKZuE
@SeanHooper2 you remind me of a sloth.. That is all.
Last chem lab of the semester = no more wearing pants in 80 degree weather. 
Here we go back, this is the moment, tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over.
Rarely went to class, and still made higher than the honors students on the test. 
@bitsycreecher &lt;3 you! That just means a free trip to Charleston for you!
@its_savanna @julianamarieh stop! It is not, it's just the best reason!
@its_savanna @julianamarieh it's got a pool 
Finally have a job and house for the summer in Charleston! #seeyaRockThrill 
Losing your favorite pair of norts is possibly one of the most depressing things possible. #fwp 
Casual selfie with my main dog on this beautiful Charleston day.  http://t.co/cpRJj2xluz
@DainaChase: 9 months till i get my braces off.. Please come fast. 9 months till I get a new car. Please come fast!!
@itsDorry: i love bad fishes thats my fuckin' problem &amp; yeah i touched the butt i got a fuckin' problem @julianamarieh
\"I don't like uninvited dick touching my butt\"  @its_savanna @bstallworths
@CommonWhiteGirI: Breaking News: North Korea's bomb has just arrived on US soil http://t.co/yhMnsnExcu @bstallworths
@DainaChase it's cool, mom and dad are coming to see me this weekend and you're not! COOL.
\"For a while I thought animals gathered around each other periodically like they do in the lion king.\" - @bstallworths 
@lyard12 haha no. We just left!
Carolina cup... Already a shit show.
@julianamarieh one hour later... Wait until you see ours #AWESOME
Best one yet!  #nickyflash http://t.co/gKWVvfyZ4Y
I love fake yawning in a waiting room and seeing how many people start to yawn. 
Thinking a test is a later date than it really is, is possibly one of the most disappointing feeling.
@JohnLClark you too! Hope you enjoyed your time in charleston!
People who do not respect your stuff &lt;&lt;&lt;
@WolfpackAlan: I'm not drunk... Floors need hugs too. #truth... @bstallworths @its_savanna
@noo_worries wait! In charleston?! What time are y'all playing?!
The kid sitting behind me sounds like Darth Vader. 
@its_savanna  agreed! love you!!!
Who needs sleep anyways?! Not me obviously 
We may or may not have taken all of these from the cafeteria @bstallworths  #cupcakehoarders #nom http://t.co/KqCTzeXmnZ
Getting a 99 on my chemistry test has put me in the best mood ever!!!
Why can't we just eat books and obtain all the information in them that way instead of studying?!
@bitsycreecher: All these people are like \"get me to summer!!\" &amp; I'm sitting here like, don't make me sit in Rock Hill for 3 months amen
Already considering sleeping all weekend. #exhausted
Waking up wouldn't be that bad if I could just snap my fingers and instantly be ready.
@DainaChase next time keep your phone in your pants so I can track your entire movement during the game 
@DainaChase good luck at your game #creepstatus http://t.co/St13bYe6ZJ
Why do I even show up to class my teacher has made it an every class thing to randomly disappear for half the class?
I really need to learn how to ride a bike in Charleston.
Best part of Mondays: watching 2 Broke Girls with @bstallworths
Mondays.. http://t.co/Wpg8J3vyKH
I really can't remember what was a dream or what was real life last night...
Okay it's only been 4 hours, but I'm having separation anxiety from @its_savanna.
My new lock screen with my favorite girls ever @bstallworths @its_savanna @julianamarieh @DainaChase http://t.co/8xwnCCI2P5
@DainaChase: My dive at the game tonight might of made my life. #finally I soo proud of my sister 
Test anxiety to the max for the first time ever 
Me before I take a hard test. http://t.co/LmNLJdel8q
It is physically impossible for me to go to bed before 3 am now. #uh 
Happy Birthday @jake_youngblood!! Miss you!
Coolest hat award goes to this guy! http://t.co/Q6Z4L0k5cA
@margaretculp stop! This guy already gives me nightmares when he came in with moldy socks on! 
I think the guy in front of me has more cat hair on his sweater than on his actual cat...
I think the guy in front of me has more cat hair on his sweater than on his actual cat...
@tHinson15 yes! It was way to early.
The first class after spring break is possibly one of the hardest classes to go to.
@shitgirlssay: Will you take our picture? @its_savanna
@DainaChase you better text me when she does!!
I have less than 2 more months here in Charleston, it needs to get warm like now!
Road trip with my girls @julianamarieh and @its_savanna to Hilton Head to see our fav person @The_King_42!!
@sammymt12 dang, I was in Athens last weekend! Bad timing!
@its_savanna has my heart &lt;333 !
Where's da fuqqq is @bstallworths?! I miss her like aaa lott. 
I'm gonna live where the green grass grows. Watchin' my corn pop up in rows. Every night be tucked in close to you.
@its_savanna one more thing to add to how eventful spring break has been!
@Joseph_Eddy11 hahaha I think my mom got it way worse than when you did!
Welp, mom crashed into my car. Now it's even more of a piece of crap than it was before.
@bitsycreecher: \"Rihanna's S&amp;M Sung By a Weird kid\" look it up on YouTube I have literally never felt more uncomfortable  omg.
Today has been very eventful... @bstallworths @its_savanna
@bstallworths @its_savanna I think death hit me with a shovel
Subtweeted @DainaChase TWICE this week and she didn't notice either! Lame.
I miss my sisstttaaaaa so much!!

Throwback Thursday to @bstallworths's awkward days (which is every day) http://t.co/dOeSLiyceG
I have never winged a test as bad as I just did in my stats test.
I am the most indecisive person in the world.
Missing the season premiere of Duck Dynasty because that is the one channel I do not get  #sadtweet
@julianamarieh http://t.co/WOkoHy4Pp9
@its_savanna obviously goes on a twitter rampage when she's sleep deprived.
@BLFender22 hahaha... Congrats on your first somewhat funny insult. 
Nothing makes being in class worse than when the person around you smells like feet.
@sammymt12 @seanhooper2 couldn't have said it better!
@SeanHooper2: Any chance there'll be something fun going on in Rock Hill next week when I'm home? What a dumb question.
@SlothLoveLife: bitches love the slothsa @SeanHooper2
Seriously rain, GTFO.
If I fall along the way, pick me up and dust me off. And if I get too tired to make it, be my breath so I can walk.
Bailey needs to quit bragging, some people have sisters who show their love in other ways, like by not sending them gifts...  #subtweet
I got a serious case of the Mondays.
I do not want the weather today to ever end.
@kelseybell94: seriously though http://t.co/5WvRXx7QG4 @bstallworths
Too soon for raccoons in cacoons.
My friends are a mess.
@bstallworths that was really sweet an made me happy... Until I saw the last two hash tags &gt;:(
@bstallworths: My 1500 tweet goes you to my homie/ bestest bitch/ goat enthusiast/ awesome fraaand @ashleyhchase #loveyou
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones.

I officially am in love with goats 
I finally finish Gossip Girl, now what am I going to do with my life?!
Of course I would get called out to stand in front of the class the one day I did not shower or get ready for class 
@bstallworths 5:1 #suckit

#lifeofaprincess http://t.co/cHH4t59r
You need to want it to happen. And you need to want it bad enough to make it happen.
@DainaChase 
@SeanHooper2 ...........no. Just no.............
USC vs Liberty baseball game with @SeanHooper2! Good luck @sammymt12!!
HELLO BASEBALL SEASON 
When the gym is completely empty and that one other person picks the treadmill right next to you 
The fact that my high school team had their first scrimmage today &amp; I'm not playing any more is possibly the saddest realization ever.
\"What's a boberry biscuit?\" -bailey. \n I just don't understand her sometimes..
@DainaChase mom already told me she's sending me something, and since I'm the favorite, my gift will be the better. 
@DainaChase aca-cuse me?!
@Savannahlj93 it took a little less than two hours!
#GoHeels
@its_savanna I liked both of your last tweets! I would've called you out and embarrassed you for the puddle like you do to me 
Seriously, I miss all these free T-shirt opportunities on campus by like 5 minutes. 
If there was any day that I wished my classes would be canceled, then today would be that day.
@its_savanna @bstallworths go home rainbow you're drink @SeanHooper2
@its_savanna STAPH. Lies!!!
Hey Columbia! @SeanHooper2 $&amp; I will see you Friday!!

This morning http://t.co/dWK0K7hx
@bstallworths I don't know why I wasn't following you.... That was the weirdest moment ever!
@its_savanna  ill be waiting! Haha
Today is the perfect day to lay in bed and watch Netflix.
Carrie Underwood is sheer perfection.
I just want to sleep until next weekend.
Love my suitemate  @bstallworths http://t.co/8vSjkJfx
Mimosas with my girls @julianamarieh @its_savanna @bstallworths @KendallKnecht

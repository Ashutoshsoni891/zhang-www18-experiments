Another reason to train alone. I only have one white man to hate.
Another reason to train alone. Do it whenever I fucking want.
Another reason to train alone. Dont have to discuss sports center.
That feeling you get when you realize Brad Snyder is your Bestie.
Another reason for training alone: your ass better be real or your fucking dead.
Yet another reason to train alone. In my underwear.
Another reason to lift alone. Work on your weak points.
If your spouse doesnt support your lifting. Find a new one.
People that rather sit at home and do nothing over lifting amaze me.
#2 reason to lift alone. No one there to hold you up when it feels good.
My son turned 16 today. So proud of the man hes become. James Savage.
Reason #1 not to have training pertners\n . They want to do it their way.

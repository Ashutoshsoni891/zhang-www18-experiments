Sucks to suck.  maybe next time you will remember that before rear ending someone again.
Plus an extra $500 from the driver who caused the accident from his insurance. 
Can't wait to finally bring home a new car! My insurance is probably the best! They are even paying me for missing work!
I'm getting way more then I exoected! It's time to bring home a new car once again!
My car was a total loss, but the representative told my parents I'm gonna give your daughter above average for how immaculate it was.

making some breakfast burritos!
my neck hurts sooo bad
the strip that my accident happened on along with the other before mine is called \"death man valley\" it has very good reasons for that name.
wanna know something even more crazy. the reason why everyone came to a complete stop was because of another accident ahead of us
since my accident was on m37, many of my friends and their parents seen it happen while driving by, my manager from work even saw it happen
my neck, my back, my cheeks, my jaw.. is so unbelievably sore its not even funny.
gonna wake up tomorrow feeling just great...
maybe I can make a small joke out of this but, maybe my stubbornness did come in handy for once tonight after hitting whatever tf it was.
He has sent me an Angel. I was so lucky being able to walk out of the back of an ambulance and into the arms of loved ones.
if the timing was any different... the outcome would have been fatal.
and that she missed my door side by inches and nearly trapping me inside... God had this planned out...
he made sure that when we got pushed into oncoming traffic that the other driver didn't hit us head on at 55+ an hour...
God made everything happen like it did.. he made sure that the guy had his brakes on before he hit us...
I wonder why God decided to keep us alive?
everything will be okay. just gotta keep telling myself that.
Tonight, I could have died. But I had a guardian angel. My life flashed before my eyes. I'm looking at life differently now.
I know I got shit I need to work on, I know I've hurt some people who didn't deserve it.
ughhh gotta love shopping for a new car once again

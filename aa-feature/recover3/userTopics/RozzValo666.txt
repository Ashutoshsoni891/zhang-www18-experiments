Never challenge me to a wine drinking contest. You will lose not only the contest but money as well.
Suddenly thinking of my biological father.... FUCK him
Well my stepfather continues to take care of me even in death. Thank you dad for this. I shall use it properly.
Great time with the band. I'm so happy. It feels good to be happy and not depressed. I dedicate my wine to my band mates.
@that_weirdchick My thoughts exactly.
Bottle of wine and Friday the 13th movie. I would love to have a bottle of wine with @JasonLVoorhees
@that_weirdchick Alcohol makes life better
Quite right https://t.co/NTzCWCGJNd
Kind of proud of myself. I did a nearly 60 second scream. The crowd loved it too. I feel accomplished.
Kickass session with the band. Chugged an entire bottle of wine in one sitting haha. Feels good to be myself again.
I'll never change who I am. Yes I'm a drinker. That will never change. My blood is red wine and I'm proud of it. Now to drink more wine.
One bottle down, and another to go. https://t.co/F4CmbJmsGV
I missed my wine. I shouldve never stopped drinking it. https://t.co/etdCprlCgY
Me and the band haven't lost it. I missed them. Now we shall go get really fucking drunk.
God bless the pub.
Glad my old band mates let me back in. I loved and missed those blokes. Drinks are on me.
@mauroranallo The best way you can really destroy guys like JBL, Is to to still smile. Assholes like him hate to see the victim strong.
@mauroranallo JBL bullying you? QUICK SOMEONE CALL @JoeyStyles For real mate, I hope you this made you smile. Bully hate to see happiness.
Drank wine from a woman's body... I'm really going places haha. So much fun.
Alcohol has been my only consistent friend through my life. I love it so much. Red wine for all.
Why did I ever stop drinking? I love it so much
@Ladyvader6969 Happy early birthday love.
Felt good to go to the pub again.
Wine tasted quite good. I know I can drink alcohol just not overdo it again. Feels good to drink again.
@Ladyvader6969 miss you love
Glass of wine sounds wonderful right now
@barrymanilow congrats mate! very happy for you. my family is big fans of your music. i hope you're able to find the comfort you deserve!
That moment when your niece asks you where babies come from...
Happy to say my older brother is feeling better and he'll be going home soon. I'm also proud to say that I stuck by him the entire time.
I've known about HIM breaking up for a bit now but I still can't believe it. I'm going to miss the band so bloody much. #HIMfan4ever
@JRsBBQ My condolences to my favourite announcer of all time. You're in my prayers JR. God bless you mate. May your beautiful wife rest easy
My heart breaks at the terrorist attacks in my home country...  stay strong London
Been there. https://t.co/87ugrRLRpQ
Don't wanna brag but my mates little brother bragging about how many beers he can drink just makes me laugh I could drink 45 lmao.
Felt like I just hugged my brother for the last time.....
Really hard to stay sober when you're drinking red wine in front of me. Still love you my lovely sister in law but yeah...
Sucks mum and I are always fighting now ...
@LeatherDarling @LuciferianFire @6Morbid6Freak6 @josephishope @Bloody_Queen303 Come play with us Rozz. Forever and ever.
Nothing like hearing your brother sing HIM in the shower...
Brother says he's feeling better thank god....
I'm calling 2017 the worst year ever already. My favourite band is breaking up. #heartacheverymoment.
HIM FOREVER!!! &lt;\3
My heart is broken. HIM is breaking up.
And you can bring happiness in my world and I can add suffering in your world.
Older brother not looking good... he's so sick right now... please god... don't let this be what I think it is...
Although my brother is sick he's not sick enough to not prank me. Now if you'll excuse me I need to get this tack out of my bum
I don't care how sick I get, I refuse to leave my brother's side. He was there for me and I will be there for him.
I don't hate americans but I wish the tourists wouldn't fuck with the Queens guard... which is why the bloke got knocked out. Lesson learned
I'm so scared for my brother...
Nothing more awkward than walking in on your older brother and your sister in law making out in a hospital bed....
My brothers wife is such a hugger.... "oh christopher it's so lovely to see you" then she proceeds to hug me to hell...
It's 7 am and now you're offering me a more comfortable chair? Bloody hell where were you earlier when I was sleeping? Lmao
@6Morbid6Freak6 then I'd throw him to the ground and we'd have a brother fight lmao
@6Morbid6Freak6 It's funny this seems like the exact kind of picture we'd take lol.
I pray you make it through this brandon. Until then I will not leave your hospital bed no matter what.
I still remember us beating up those assholes at mum and out stepfathers wedding party at the pub. Wouldn't be us without a pub fight.
Thanks for loving what mum called "the family alcoholic screw up" you always stood up for me.
He taught me how to drive how to shave how to cook. I'll cherish our memories brandon. I love you my brother. Thanks for loving me.
And playing video games. Castlevania all night long and falling asleep in class. Despite everything I love my older brother.
Sitting at my brothers bedside listening to old stories. I miss the days when we were just young boys staying up late watching horror movies
Sorry I've been away everyone. My older brother is in rough shape. Not looking very good right now and I'm very worried.
Spent a lot of time at my stepfathers grave today. I miss him. &lt;\3

@Poletalexandra7 @JossettHermanni @VampireHeart69 @6Morbid6Freak6 @rossvalentine_ just imagine being there it would've been amazing
@Poletalexandra7 @JossettHermanni @VampireHeart69 @6Morbid6Freak6 @rossvalentine_ I second this. I would've loved to have been at Woodstock
25 pull-ups done. Not bad for a chubby fuck like me.
All gym and no drink makes Rozz a happy boy
@6Morbid6Freak6 @JossettHermanni https://t.co/Jd8fmBLxwF
Gym kicked my English ass today. I think it's time for Rozz to get abs ;)
Yep... bruised ribs are fun.
I gave her my heart she didn't want it. Took it anyway put a dark spell on it....
@6Morbid6Freak6 ah father dracula.
@6Morbid6Freak6 that works too. Dracula castle adventuring, and maybe finding his grave. Sounds epicly fun.
@6Morbid6Freak6 england? ;)
@6Morbid6Freak6 thank you ville the cat and thank you sweetie
No more fucking alcohol. No more for me.
Got rid of all my empty vodka and wine bottles. Made me wanna drink more. That part of my life is over.
God bless the people at my AA meetings. They're making this journey a lot easier.
@LeatherDarling Yeah, I'm glad that I'm doing this.
First AA meeting done. Real therapeutic.

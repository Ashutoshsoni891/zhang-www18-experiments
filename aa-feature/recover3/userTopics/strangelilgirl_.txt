Stella wonders is my wedding gown will fit her when she grows up. http://t.co/bBaPFXgUOH
Ripping hundreds of CDs onto my laptop. Why I didn't do this before is beyond me. http://t.co/RLeopG2G0T
Kit-Fu doesn't approve of thunderstorms. But he looks handsome anyhow. http://t.co/JGm8hyXHhr
Oh hey twitter. You're still here.
Don't have the strength to carry your heavy load of life.
Bye bye Detroit. @ Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) http://t.co/oykWcBp7zB
Waiting forever. @ Philadelphia International Airport http://t.co/8swyOlHwar
Tomorrow I will be sleeping in my own bed with my fur babies. I'm happy I got to see my husband, but I'm eager to get home too.
I shouldn't be this happy to have a female captain on my flight. But I am. Philadelphia, I shall see you soon.
Duke and Lil Bit love each other. I hardly get pics of them cuddling. http://t.co/M5Yk2Pm5Zi
@TheDookness I'm watching it now. But that doesn't help you at all. I am hating Vee.
I really hope I'm not becoming that asshole who posts nothing but selfies. http://t.co/CVXXn0nAkS
Just posted a photo http://t.co/tkS9zEX016
I really should have stayed home methinks. So tired...
Insert witty comment here. http://t.co/IWANi5qMGv
@TheDookness kick them in the shin. Then in the jaw.
My husband is amazing at making me feel better. http://t.co/lIiMQTnWyY
Kit-Fu is having an existential crisis. http://t.co/T4v1gT0EJZ
Oh look. I'm reverting to my teenage years again. http://t.co/JYhttpBsB4
He never lets me get creative. Haha. http://t.co/7uFWyWNoze
I shouldn't be this excited to get a piece of plastic. But I made it to 30 days of sobriety. Here's to the next 30... http://t.co/YeyxxqSuDU
Packing for T's emergency outage.  http://t.co/h0q6RvrnuL
Okay, I just joined tumblr. @toricentanni How does this work? Haha.
@LeahBea_ if I could drive and whatnot I would come visit you.
Stella thinks Duke's bed is her bed now. http://t.co/k7s3O5HDpZ
I made it through a house party sober. I wanted to cry at the end, but I made it.
@LeahBea_ aw, you should come over and we can bitch about guys together.
I'm thinking I may wind up strangling this kid before the night is over. No patience, and sobriety sucks when everyone else is drinking.
Dude, she's fucking using you. Why won't you ever get that through your head?
I'm going to try to make today a good day.
I'm beginning to think that a majority of my friends don't like me anymore.
They want us to shut down our livelihood. Get your right to farm back http://t.co/hxbtB8W6ql @moveon
Happy Birthday @TheDookness! I hope it was a lovely day for you.
@LeahBea_ I'm just too damn insecure. It's probably nothing, but I always fear the worst. See you Saturday?
I'm beginning to think you are hiding things from me again.
Wondering if my husband will ever come home. He's been gone all day.
Again, my life has turned into an endless cycle of doctors, psychiatrists, AA meetings, and anxiety all rolled into one. I wanna give up.
I sometimes feel like I need the voice of a friend. Talking to doctors and counselors and psychiatrists may not be enough.
@sanderse Your account got hacked dear.
Lakeland healthcare blocks tumblr for cursing. Well fuck.
New hair! http://t.co/KFn9tVFlyv
Well, first AA meeting wasn't terrible. I still don't know what to think about it though.

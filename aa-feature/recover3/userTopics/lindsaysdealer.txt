@_kelseyrabbit that's still not BPD but ok
@_kelseyrabbit BPD is borderline personality disorder... And this is so inaccurate what a manic and depressive state is. Stay educated
For those of you who are undiagnosed bipolar. Bipolar isn't extreme mood swings.
For those of you who don't know, BPD is not the same as bipolar disorder. BPD is borderline personality disorder. You're welcome and goodbye

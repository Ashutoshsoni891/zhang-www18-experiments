But still.....FFFAAAAMMMMMMMM!!!Too close for comfort bruh
Well, actually he was white
Then again, she couldn't trust these niggas either.....
See? Can't trust these bitches out here bruh.

I wish I lived on Guam, @YoungPikachu could totally be down like that
I need a female friend who just likes to text, watch Netflix, eat, send nudes, suck dick and fuck
Worst thing cell phone companies ever did was start offering unlimited talk
If you can't even hold my interest via text, wtf I'mma waste my time calling you for??
Besides, I text first to make sure the convo is worth sitting on the fucking phone for
I'm already watching a movie AND tryna write, it's more convenient to text so I can do both and still talk to you
And even if our convo is legit, I like to multitask
We ain't teenagers no more. We're grown. Don't nobody got time to be sittin on the phone for hours and hours shooting the shit.
Phone calls should be for when you've legit got something to discuss. Not just shooting the shit.
On God, why do bitches love to talk on the fucking phone so goddamn much??
@CindyTraining #AmazonChaser http://t.co/bON5wA4y8V

While his boys are out doing dirt, Fisk woos a woman with wine and the Goldberg Variations. Cultured as fuck.
He actually makes a very human Fisk. I like his character already......
Vincent D'Onofrio is the fucking MAN as Fisk!!!! Spot on casting @Daredevil!!!!

Oh well, guess I'll wake her up with more head
She's so mad she literally fumed herself to sleep
So I'm on call for work and I just had to answer the phone in the middle of giving my gf head
After this weekend tho, I'm buckling down
Weekend staycation, food, new gym gears and shoes. God, I needed this.
Started the weekend off with $1,300. After bills and shopping I'll be lucky to have $260. Totally worth it tho.
@Mz_NikkiSweets bruh was MADE for those types of roles lmao

@PhotoChik lmao let's go
@PhotoChik lmao where do you get it???
@PhotoChik Mmmmmmm that might help. I've heard of it but never tried it myself......
@PhotoChik lol that's true. But I'm learning to be different. I don't wanna fix you, just be here for someone in need
@PhotoChik I have some of the same hang ups too. I guess, overall, you should love your body no matter what but still have lil problem areas
@PhotoChik u can have 2 ppl both weigh 200 lbs and look completely different
@PhotoChik I understand that. But it's not so much about the numbers, more so how the weight looks on u.
@PhotoChik according to who/what?
@PhotoChik I've seen plenty of women in various states of dress and undress and body types and you are not fat. At all. Trust me.
@PhotoChik why don't you???
I keep forgetting to take pics when that happens
Just got head at work. I do this

I'm ranting but I am in complete and utter shock
Artistry suffers
The lights of the world grow dimmer and dimmer with each one snuffed out
I didn't know Monty personally, but like many, I've been a huge  fan since \"Haloid\". From the beginning you could tell he was special.
I'm not saying those with less passion for life should all die, it's unfair that the universe would rather take those who try to change it
Why do the ones overflowing with life get taken discriminately while those barely clinging to life continue on?
Hell, ALL the time. Why do the brightest lights always fade the quickest?
I just don't understand this world sometimes

I'd gangbang a chick with my brothers tho. Does that make me hypocritical? No I don't think so. Maybe a tad double-standardish.....
But I could NEVER be in a poly relationship with someone who was also having sex with my brother. That would just be too weird for me.
I mean, being poly - minded I guess it's no big deal having multiple sexual partners while in a relationship

Having a personality disorder does not put you on the autism spectrum. So YOU are neurotypical as well.
There's nothing wrong with supporting those on the spectrum but unnecessarily lumping yourself in with them because you've got issues.....no
If you're not on the autism spectrum, STOP condescending to people who aren't by referring to us as neurotypical
Your gender or sexual orientation really shouldn't be scrutinized and ridiculed like it has been traditionally.....
I love the traction this whole LGBTQ movement is getting

I miss just chilling with her, going on little outings and discovering new little nooks of the city
And we've still got like another 10 weeks
I think it's the fact that we've been away from each other for so long
It's weird to feel so much ambivalence about someone or something
She's the only woman on Earth who both infuriates me and fills me with so much love and completeness
Nobody compares to bae thoI love my lil red head

Finally finished Death Note. Shit was dope af.
Anyway
Skeet skeet skeet bitch
Get a vasectomy and just start nuttin' in all these hoes
I swear I'm bout to be single for life. No bae, no wifey, no boo just bitches......
I kept it 100 and stayed within the rules we both agreed to yet I'm the one who gets painted as the bad guy?
I fucked ONE girl ONE TIME and all of a sudden, she can't deal with it and flips psycho on me like I did something wrong
Me and my gf agreed back in the day we could fuck other ppl. She had THREE guys she was fucking semi-regularly not including me
I'm not just talking out of my ass, I have lived this shit
That's partly true, but men only cheat cause when we tried to keep it 100 with y'all, you weren't trying to hear that
But men can't cause we just cheat for no reason so we're just untrustworthy
Females think it's ok for them to hang with an opposite gender friend because they're female and they won't cheat
Um.....yes you did bitch. YOU DISREGARDED THE RULES!!!
So they set up rules that are supposed to be 4 everyone but keep breaking them then use that \"But I didn't do nothing\" excuse
Females CANNOT keep it 100. They wanna be able to have free reign but as soon as a nigga do, it's like \"Awwwwww hell nah!\"
Honestly, hypocrites piss me off more than anything in this world. Especially when I tell you beforehand \"Just be 100 with me.\"
 RT\"@delafro_: Whenever I see black guys cape for racist white women, I'm just like.. Fam. They don't give a fuck about you.... wyd?\"
Bitches have no fear of they niggas anymore. Instead, we fear them and don't do shit when they fuck up.
Let me do that shit, she'll be screening my calls, threatening to leave me, all kinds of shit. Not me tho. I just sit here and fume.
If we agree not 2 go 2 strip clubs with other ppl, it is NOT ok 4 u 2 do it when ur out with ur \"friend\" for ANY reason
The rules should apply to everybody across the fucking board
But the moment a guy does, he's an asshole, a misogynist, etc
I don't understand why females think they can do whatever the fuck they want whenever they want and it's ok because females should be able 2
Ugggghhhh it's times like these I wonder A. Why dafuq did I ever get in a relationship in the first place, and B. Why dafuq do I stay?
@YoungPikachu not shit. Just chillin, watching DEATH NOTE.
@YoungPikachu 
Light.....L......Near......it's amazing that the series has gone on this long
Still watching DEATH NOTE......I swear, these ppl be figuring shit out immediately like they're fucking psychic
Whatev. I'm bout to just write and watch Death Note.
This is why niggas don't gaf
When are we gonna outgrow this childish shit?
A bitch will chew her nigga out for doing something then turn around and do the exact same thing like it ain't shit

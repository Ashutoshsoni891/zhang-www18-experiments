This whole sleeping thing.....no bueno
I'll never give up while I'm still breathing
And to answer your question, yes, I've lost everything I've had. But I'm not dead. At least not yet.
I'm still alone, alive, and most importantly, I'm still unbroken. Nothing can ever bring me down for long.
@nattypeks yea she's a total sweethheart. You should her when she headbangs in her car seat it's the best thing EVER! It makes me so proud.
So no one wants to hear tht gig I did? Tough crowd

Trying to take a nap, can't sleep.I keep thinking there's a stripper out there pole dancing to Willow Smith's 'Whip My Hair' and I'm scared.
The only people excited for the 'Entourage' movie are those guys who go up to girls at parties and ask why they're not smiling.
Yea eddy, I care.
@StarlishaP thanks pal! You're a true friend.
@StarlishaP I KNOW!!!! 9/10 it went off senior year it was because of me. Like that day when it was pouring outside. I guess I'm that good
@StarlishaP I pulled it in spirit! I was the king of pulling the alarm at the high school...
@StarlishaP I know, calling everyone \"man\" is a bad habit. My apologies....by the way, I totally pulled the fire alarm.

@abbbby_liz you wanna rap? That's fuckin wack, I bet it'll sound like crap,  All you ever do is yap. So shut your damn trap!
The fact that I'm alive today amazes me. And there's a very legitimate reason for that. I can never repay that person by failing.

Just makin sure
For real though, where's Orrest?
Or what if I'm not missing out? What if @newhouse_julia isn't as awesome as I think?
It almost feels like a lost cause, like I'll never see those people I should've gotten to know ever agian. And it sort of makes me sad.
Also, what the fuck happened to Orrest? Everyone's favorite Foreign exchange student.
I've come to realize how awesome some of my peers are.Too bad I didn't get to know them while we were still in school. Like @newhouse_julia

I don't care if you don't like me.
Which may be equally sad, but I can't help it. It's just the way it is.  And that's how it will always be. Whether I exist to you or not #PV
You seem to ignore the one who adores you, and you pay more attention to chasing those who ignore you. How sad. I'll always love you though.
I'm gonna pass out

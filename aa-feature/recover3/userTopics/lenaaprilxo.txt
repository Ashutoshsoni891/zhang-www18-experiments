These girls born in the 90's are dangerous... @theweeknd #tattoo #bbtm #heels #acquainted http://t.co/cDxaQrkQWP
I'm not afraid anymore.@theweeknd's story will evolve, and he will continue to write honest music.We are privileged to follow the journey.XO
anyways, i fucking loved the #popcast, and am currently roaming the streets playing the album from beginning to end. @theweeknd
i forgot often and the hills, but its probably @theweeknd showing you know who his world and his life before the love becomes obvious.
and angel, well. that speaks for itself. an obvious love with lingering fear and doubt...
shameless, earned it, as you are, dark times, cfmf, prisoner are all tug of war songs, as the #popcast put it
the ending \"these girls born in the 90s are dangerous\" seems to be both about his fear and smoldering intrigue
acquainted, the title a literal placeholder for when he got acquainted with you-know-who, and its still dark and sexy, but he has hope..
tell your friends is a then-and-now song throwing back to the HoB and what life was like then. the dark, slow ending echoes into..
labrinth is probably there to represent @lamarXO in losers, the first chapter where they drop out and move out
so real life is like the preface.. framing his story with his mom's concerns about his future.
The #popcast about @theweeknd was SO insightful and well phrased and got me to thinking... @joncaramanica @benratliff
Can't go wrong with free swag... @Uber_Canada @theweeknd #UberXO http://t.co/TvmYXbrwLs

On the plus side, somebody who won the Uber tix clearly wasn't that excited cause they left their swag on the road.  Free shirt for me.
Couldn't even hear the songs from outside...
Not my day at all :( @theweeknd drove by so fast I couldn't even see him ;.; shit. :( :(
Very disappointing to not get tix :( :( :( :( :( but I'm gonna go stand outside the mod club and cry now.

Wow.. I haven't felt like this in a while. Pacing slowly. Acquainted on repeat. @theweeknd
With all of the ticket chasing I did yesterday, I hardly had a chance to properly enjoy the album. Here we go. Earphones in.
Thanks SO much @TessaOnAir for interviewing me on @VirginRadioTO! It was SO fun!I am a dork. Here it is: https://t.co/0M3QjeOzOO @theweeknd

He's still the artist we love.
It makes so much sense to hear it all together.
It makes so much sense to hear it all together.
I don't know how to explain this right. I really didn't expect this. I know Abel's a genius but I didn't know he still had... This.
This is so fucking amazing. I can hardly move.
Fuck.
This is really fucken special though.\nIts different, but it doesnt just sound like superficial pop.
Guys i dont know how to say this but im listening to this leak and.... Like.... I thought the album would make me sad.
So worn out from this day but I'm off to the CNE to see @VirginRadioTO.
The stress is killing me I'm just crying on the side of the street ugh :(
It happened again @VirginRadioTO, it just rang and rang to the end of the song. Is there something wrong? This never happened before today.
&lt;3 @Quinn_Bell lent me a sweater so I don't have to go all the way home before heading back to @VirginRadioTO ^_^ http://t.co/VVH35x90hZ
I could hardly breathe it was awful I'm shaking ;.; aghhh
That 12pm was so so awful. I got through and it rang for the entire song. I guess that means I was like #10 or something :( @VirginRadioTO
I'm so cold I don't think I can rely on my fingers to click \"call\". I'm going home to get a sweater! Bye bye @VirginRadioTO!

Every time the @theweeknd contest ad plays on @VirginRadioTO, I get a stress headache, I swear.

Dear @VirginRadioTO, I'm pretty sure I get connected faster when I call from just outside the building :p http://t.co/7unvY4a5RT
I wonder if @VirginRadioTO was prepared for the onslaught of XO fans... we're ridiculously dedicated. @theweeknd
Do I sound like I'm joking? *laughs evily*
Why, you ask? Because I don't know what to do with myself, other than to frantically run around in circles! * @VirginRadioTO
I seriously think I'm going to go hang outside the @VirginRadioTO building with a pathetic sign as I call in for their contest.
Rats @VirginRadioTO !
It's official:  I'm selling my soul to @VirginRadioTO in hopes of getting tickets. x)
God another day of unspeakable tears approaches\nI'm gonna hear the songs from outside the club\nWhy do I do this to myself?\nOh yeah b/c Abel
This is gonna be exhausting. Every time I see @theweeknd it is.. Its like my damn soul is rebirthing or something, Christ
@tailopez we can't ignore you because your lambourghini ad plays on every damn yt video ever! ;)
@odalysxxo *looks at your stunning profile pic*\n*wonders what the fuck your sister looks like to make you want that*
Would any xo fam want to join me in this venture? :p
I tried to deny it,  but it's obvious I'm going to sit on the street outside Mod Club on the 25th and cry. @theweeknd
@_modelbehavior @theweeknd I'm sorry. This really sucks.  from one sad xo fan to another &lt;3
dear followers, sorry for my ranting, but it made me feel better.\nand thank you @MaraDyne for checking in. &lt;3
now my plan is to go to wal mart and it's pouring outside and i'll prolly cry all the way there. tears in the rain. xo jokes.
I'm SO fucking sad.
This is horrible.  I'm so fucking sad.
This is fucking ridiculous.  Now I'm going to be haunted by the fact that I could have got tickets if I didn't. just. close. the. page.
why is this happening! why did the site say they are sold out when they're not! why did i close the page :(
I just need to know what's going on :( :( :(
I just need to know what's going on :( :( :(
@VirginRadioTO I lost my place I was like 700 in the queue
@VirginRadioTO is there another website or phone line you're talking about?
.@VirginRadioTO I called the company and they said \"I hope they know what they're talking about\" and they told me that they were sold out?
I'm fucking SCREAMING you mean I could have got tickets if I didn't close the fucking window?!?? :( :( :(
now i called the site and i'm just shaking and crying what the hell is this fuck
Now I'm over 6000! This is so fucking awful, this is so bad.
You mean to tell me that if I hadn't closed the page - which said they were sold out - I still would be 700 in the queue? :( :( :( :( :(
@SpEdSaid @VirginRadioTO It's not :( I'm over 6000 in the queue :(
@VirginRadioTO @SpEdSaid WHAT DO YOU MEAN? Should I have waited in the queue? :( :( :(
i don't know why i'm watching my twitter feed like its going to change anything
i'm so sad i don't know what to do with myself
@VirginRadioTO @theweeknd @SpEdSaid What?!?!? I don't see any!!!
i mean i'm so happy abel's saw this success but i guess this is just the way it is now.  there's so many fans. so many.
this is all wrong :(
i guess it's just bad luck...
it just sucks to be one of those ppl that will wait 15 hours in advance to get front row at a concert but there was no way i could get these
I'm fucking devastated
this is fucking awful. :(
goodbye crying now
i don't understand there was only about 200 ppl ahead of me.  they got all of the tickets???!?!
they're actually sold out!!!! :(
NO!!! D:
@xoamberr jesus fuck! this is awful! :(
if it's two tickets per person....  i mean, there's no way 500 ppl are waiting at this time and just won't buy tickets..... no no no
WTF I'm number #773 in line?!? HOW!! I was watching the counter count down!!! this is so bad ;.; I am shaking so bad

Maybe this is obvious, but I'm just starting to figure that in the CFMF video, that was not actually Abel dancing. #AlsoSantasNotReal
Unf august 28 this is happening
I still can't believe were getting a fucking LANA COLLAB! :D
Pulling the more easily digestible beauty out from inside the dark, foggy, anxiety-wrecked madness.
#bbtm first reactions :p\n@theweeknd #theweeknd http://t.co/sCMaBFUipF
@MaraDyne Awww. &lt;3 Thank you &lt;3
Sober since June 28. Happy 1 month to me. :) #recovery http://t.co/n0888Aak6x
The #cfmf video drops on the 1 month anniversary of my sobriety! I feel rewarded. And the album release will be my 2 months! :D @theweeknd
HE DID THE MICHAEL JACKSON
Gotta stay up til midnight just in case...!
\"His approach was characterized by obscurity and darkness. 'I felt I had to change who I was,' he says.\"
That article hurt my selfish soul.
\"Probably my and my managers biggest fear is if this kid falls in love, were done, were finished.\"  http://t.co/JZLFyzheYX
@MaraDyne I love you, I love you, I love you.
I made it clear to the world\nAin't nobody gonna be that somebody\nI do it all to stay warm
Baby, just be honest.
You know that I will be a call away, the call you make when you're all alone...
@MaraDyne you are just too sweet Mara &lt;3
and when it's said and done, you were better off.\nyou deserve to be in love, and i deserve to be by myself.
WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW FUNNY THIS IS @theweeknd http://t.co/eHu418G6BF
You'll be different.
Sometimes my tattoo burns, Harry Potter-style, and I become convinced @theweeknd is nearby. :p
fun fact: \"i fuck a bitch from lost&amp;found like every monday...\" l&amp;f is actually a club. too bad the yelp reviews made me want to vomit.
Dear @theweeknd, I would like to cordially invite you to the #BBTM Circle of Listening 8/28. Snacks provided.Very exclusive event. Pls RSVP.
wtf... Instagram removed my 15 second vid because the background was Can't Feel my Face... blaring in a club! ppl gonna torrent that clip??!
They played @theweeknd on my first day at my new job! Good vibes ^_^
At Crews and Tango... if I'm there, best believe I'm requesting @theweeknd! :D\n\njbrooksreid https://t.co/UTUwMTX1nB
Again, it's stupid to cry over this, but just... it's so stressful, and I feel like I've been making phone calls all day.
I'm crying again, I've done nothing but cry all day.  How is it possible that it is this difficult to just pay for the damn thing?
but then they might sell out the 500 copies and they said there's no humanly possible way to keep my order # when i re-order!
wtf the store said there's a glitch on my end AND theirs and there's nothing they can do and they can call me back later...
ABEL WHY WON'T YOU JUST TAKE MY MONEY
Sooo it's because the website was glitching, I now know. I'm currently on my 2nd call with support and my 3rd order... *fingers crossed*
@makemymindpl hopefully.  someone's re-processing the order now.
@makemymindpl Oh, I didn't see that originally.  Yes, it says signed there, but now that my order is cancelled I may have been knocked down.
I probably shouldn't be getting so stressed about this... :( :(
@makemymindpl Yes, but they cancelled it because apparently some of the information entered was wrong. I don't know for sure, though.
Trying to correct billing info now... hoping by some chance I can still retain my order number or something ;.; @theweeknd
@makemymindpl I have no idea if the signed ones are sold out - it says he'll only sign the first 500 :(
What... @theweeknd 's store cancelled the order!! :( :( :(  I'm freaking out!!  There's no way I'm still in the first 500... :( :( :(
omg i really hope i got in on the first 500 ;.;
somebody was able to help me and i just stopped crying long enough to tweet about it and no im not joking lol wtf is wrong with me
.@theweeknd please just take my money as I cry all over myself
@MaraDyne Awwww. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
shit, i forgot that money actually matters in life.
@MaraDyne You always save the day! It's not my fault I want to spend like 20 hr's wages on stupid shit.
@MaraDyne okay, I was scared of that much.  Don't worry, because venturing out wouldn't do any good. Darn CC limits. Thanks so much though&lt;3
@MaraDyne I guess I forgot to mention the 260 dollars part originally...
@MaraDyne But it's 260 dollars! So you have to have a crazy limit on your credit card.  But I have the money in my bank waiting for you.
@MaraDyne MARA YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS Can you really do that for me?!?!? I have half today and half tomorrow morning I promise you that!!
If we had some advanced notice I could have put a payment through to my VISA or something... oh god this really sucks ;.;
If they're already sold out, at least I could stop running around like a chicken with its head cut off.
How long does it take for these 500 copies of special edition to sell out? I wish I knew. :(
Crying all over myself because I don't have enough money on my credit card to buy the special edition #bbtm ;.;
#BBTM it's a good fucking day to be XO.\nthat is a title that does NOT fucking disappoint. @theweeknd
time to put on some non-xo youtube videos so i can stop reflecting and chill da fuck out.
he made it intense on purpose. played God on purpose. he's a goddamned genius. and maybe a sadist.
i don't care if i'm recycled. if i'm making an identity out of abel's scraps. i feel inspired here. i'll live here, thrive here, die here.
i love jealousy. i love hurt. i love desperation and loneliness.as long as it's sprinkled with a hint of care and an element of inspiration.
i have better things to do than blow smoke up abel's ass. :p i say these things because my feels are overflowing. gratitude and awe.
we're so lucky. so lucky. &lt;3
the thing about fans of anyrhing is they almost always want more, even when temporarily satiated. i really can't imagine that burden.
i cant believe hes never snapped at a fan. he treats his fan base with such respect.
if only one person in the world made it there life goal to meet you, that would be stressful af. and abel has how many superfans exactly?!?
not another case of Abel-caused insomnia... not again. *facepalm*
drifting off to sleep when the intense memory of @theweeknd autographing my back comes back in full force and clarity. wide awake now. O.O
he got us wanting to embrace our sins.
Just finished listening to Adaptation on my PC. When I put in my earphones to go outside, the ending of Adaptation was playing on that too:P
@MaraDyne I'm laughing so hard just picturing to you listening to the end.
@MaraDyne I AM LAUGHING WAY TOO HARD LOL.\nokay so waitwait. that song may be a tad superficial. but ONE MORE CHANCE\nhttps://t.co/3PIzQsMZzl
@xo_memes @theweeknd binge reading your twitter because you feel my soul. You have impeccable taste :D
/tweetvomit
That's a request. Pls come lie on my floor and we'll listen to @theweeknd forever. Yes.
It's weird. I'm not oblivious, I see what convos come up in @theweeknd's fan base. But all I want is to lie on the floor and listen.
KOTE. King of the Endings. Adaptation, The Host, Pretty, The Fall and Loft Music. Guh.
You put in your earphones. Visualize. Escape. You're alone. You feel alive. That's XO to me. That's @theweeknd's gift to us.
@eulabeia_ PLEASE DO :D
Being on social media talking about @theweeknd is weird b/c the music's not about gossip/selfies/etc. (not that I'm above those things)
I just listen to Trilogy and Kiss Land and I'm like... Fuck. It disturbs me when people aren't into it. Fucking masterpieces.
Seriously though #toronto come see #kotf landmarks with me ;.; @theweeknd
I should host KOTF tours. For free. Stops include: hair salon, bridge, queen/spadina, sushi place, etc CALL 555-KOTF NOW
Tweet vomit. I haven't tweeted in like a month. But I talk about @theweeknd daily. I HAVE A LOT BUILT UP OKAY
If 65 Spencer hosted tours for $100, I would pay up so fast.
I ripped both my pants, my shirts are worn as hell, and I lost a sock. HELP @OFFICIALISSUEXO @theweekndmerch @theweeknd
JUST TAKE MY MONEY PLEASE @OFFICIALISSUEXO @theweekndmerch @theweeknd
FAM! @OFFICIALISSUEXO has like 11 gazillion followers and @theweekndmerch has, like, 800. Get on dat! :)
I'm sad the store is still down. @OFFICIALISSUEXO  @theweekndmerch Another example of @theweeknd's interesting use of the word \"soon\"... ;)
I don't think there's gonna be a fall tour this year. I would beg @theweeknd to do another show in Toronto, but that would be greedy af :p
In other news, being a hardcore XO fan as well as a recovering alcoholic is a confusing mix.
Bedtime playlist: Adaptation/Love in the Sky/Next/Here Comes the Sun/Valerie/Coming Down/Same Old Song/Rolling Stone/Tears in the Rain...
\"It's 5 am, I've been high for 2 days straight and I might die\" playlist: Initiation (repeat endlessy)
Don't you forget... Don't you worry 'bout a thing. We'll be everything you need, just believe. XO @theweeknd
Help it's been 2 years and I'm still crying over Adaptation @theweeknd

@theweeknd No one is more kind and more King than you. &lt;3
@theweeknd holy shit this tweet i can't ;.;
@theweeknd @Much you were fucking amazing ;.; fuck ;.;
I couldn't do anything but sob. I am now in so much pain and and am so exhausted, but was it ever worth it. @theweeknd
He played The Hills and Earned It, such a good combo for this kind of show. And his voice sounded like goddamn gold. @theweeknd #mmva
@theweeknd's performance was fucking magnificent. @much #mmva
I am so excited I don't know what to do with myself. Fuck, I wish I could sleep!!! OMG!! This is happening!! @theweeknd #mmva @much
Despite not even sleeping last night, I doubt I can make it to the front ;.; but that's okay!!! I'm getting to see @theweeknd regardless! :D
A bit disappointing that @much has some very bizarre system for letting ppl in to #mmvas. It's basically irrelevant who waits the longest.
I'mma fall in love until they leave me... 'cause they gonna leave me. @theweeknd
I'm seeing the #mmvas on TV all the freakin' time! I'm so excited!!!!! THIS SUNDAY!!\n\nquinnntopia https://t.co/6nnzMG3SMZ
I want2 follow more @theweeknd fans that dont just post angry/\"cool\" tweets... Any nice, fun fam out there? Fav or whtvr:) #theweeknd #xofam
@bscrape are you joking? You're hating on new fans and you dont even know @theweeknd is one guy and not a band?
OMG HOLY SHIT... @theweeknd #mmva #mmvas #theweeknd #xo #xofam #toronto #queenstreet #stage #concert https://t.co/QV8JV00KnP
What is that, you ask? An IV? NO, it's my #mmva wristband that I've duct- and scotch-taped to my arm https://t.co/osoGPv8Hsk
OMG.  my #mmva bracelet came off last night!!! @Much I was able to reattach it, but as if I wasn't horrified of losing it before....!!!!
Shout out to @Oasis231mutual for playing @theweeknd for HOURS LAST NIGHT #babymakingmusic &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@theweeknd OMG. We see a link and a caption like that and we think its here!!! I just about exploded.
@eulabeia_ that is the technique right there!
50/50 chance I have nightmares about losing my #mmva wristband.
Looks like my hobby for the next week is going to be talking to other people with a #mmva wristband :D @much
#mmva wristband!!! Ohhhh my God!!!! @theweeknd @OFFICIALISSUEXO http://t.co/KF0EVX9HEO
#mmva wristbands!!!! OMG!!! See you there @theweeknd !!!! @Quinn_Bell http://t.co/3NhrKDeR24
Note to self: if you can't feel your face, it's probably because you're on the verge of passing out.
Note to self: breathing is crucial to your survival.
Note to self: don't faint when @theweeknd comes on stage.
I forget that I'm actually going to see @theweeknd . As a live person. He will actually exist on stage. Oh, God, I'm feeling faint. :p
All I can think right now is \"do I have any hope of squeezing my way to the front row?\" and \"What if the world blows up on #mmva day?\"
It's nothing but stress until the moment @theweeknd comes on stage. And then it's nothing but tears. Euphoric tears.
I am getting my #mmva wristband tomorrow, hopefully! :D @Quinn_Bell
1 week of sobriety! :)
My chest hurts thinking about the #mmvas ... Omg.
Well, I spent all morning with @Quinn_Bell in the pouring rain, but now I am at home with my number that will get me a ticket on Wed. :')
On the downside, it sounds like no matter how early you get there, it's pretty random as to who gets to be in the front row #mmva @theweeknd
Omg.. I clearly had no idea how waiting for #mmva tickets worked. I don't have to wait outside for 2.5 days!!! :D @theweeknd
Waiting for the #mmvas at 7:30 AM.\n\nquinnntopia #mmva @theweeknd #theweeknd #xo #xofam #dog #puppy https://t.co/0WG6uDyDzK

LOL! Quinn, Justin and I went to 65 Spencer last night and tried to take pics outside of it. Even https://t.co/vnz2WFb1O6
@theweeknd SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE BIG PLANS AHEAD FOR YOUR IG &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
It's rather unfortunate that every time I've seen @theweeknd I was sobbing and shaking so bad I couldn't say anything useful whatsoever.
People ask me all the time \"What would you do if you saw @theweeknd on the street?\" and I say, basically, KDKALDNNSKEKMlspapnenzJJskqjfkK000

@7463649 Sober hangouts? With Lena? Unheard of, until today! They give these coins to mark 24h, 3mo, 6mo, etc of sobriety. 24 hrs, aw yeah;)
Feeling really proud of myself today... my first #AA meeting ever. #recovery http://t.co/bGhPyJAZdR
Just reminiscing on that time @theweeknd pointed in my general direction and I fainted. Good times. I https://t.co/iL70glHhgz

So my client is in a relationship with her housemate.. When she gets mad at her she's goes, "you're so fat you need to loose 3 pounds"
My clients the cutest... Like I can't take how cute this little old lady is
@kylierose_x3 , sucks lmao
Working on my day off so I can take Thursday off and spend it at the DMV for a new license
I hate feeling like I'm to young too have it all together but I'm too old not too.. Idk

Night drive with my best friend, K
@kylierose_x3 , we'll take my car so we don't brake down on the street
Stop trying so hard for the people who don't care
Sitting patient and steady waiting for the day when I can face him. The one that can love me for who I am and so much more..
Need someone who wants to find out all that I have to give. Who can bring me what I'm missing, &amp;when I talk he wants to listen..
My brothers always pointing out that I dubbed his friend &amp; he still continues too try
Wanna go for a late night ride but I don't wanna be the one driving
I think we need to take Tiffany too her favorite street again  @kylierose_x3
"If you're not chocolate, you're not my flavor"  Tiffany knows me so well
I look at things so much differently than people I'm  friends with
As we're in Spencer's, Cassie goes "oh my god I need a boyfriend"
Can't keep ya eyes off my fatty, daddy I want you
Cassie is the catfish expert..
Love me way past forever
I swear I know Tiffany like the back of my hand.. Predicted what she was gonna do the rest of the afternoon &amp;I guess what, I WAS RIGHT
Can't say I didn't try
I'm disappointed but fuck it right ?
Lie lie lie

Currently wishing I was cuddled up so I can fall asleep
My fall back game is so strong.. Better believe that.
Put a warm towel on my belly, hope it relaxes this pain
With all the bad luck I have with cars, relationships, everything you could possibly think of, you'd think I was the worst person alive.
Crazy how someone who knew months ago what was going on in your life, has no clue about any of it.. Nothing at all..
I'm just tired of school.. actually I'm tired of everything.. Every time I move forward, something bad follows right behind. I can't win eva
Debating already if I wanna go to my class in the morning
If this isn't me... Gotta keep going though. Let go and move forward https://t.co/m9YgmtTHJu
@kylierose_x3 , No anger lol it all is what it is lol I'm 100000% over that. Yeah, you right but still. Saying it on your behalf tho lmao
@kylierose_x3 , lmao catching feelings for anyone is a no no
I hate the feeling of missing someone and being too scared to do anything about it.. Just because of the feeling of being "annoying" idek
I don't ever want to catch feelings for someone again..
I hate when I really end up liking somebody.. I just always think the worst, always be in my feelings too, shit sucks
Night drive with good music &gt;&gt;&gt;
Really tired of shitty friends who only hit me up when they need someone or something lol
In the mood to talk on the phone  but I never talk on the phone so I don't even know who I'd call... Lmao
My phone is forever dry af. Like I don't even know why I bother still having a phone lol
My phone is forever dry af. Like I don't even know why I bother still having a phone lol
Why do I have these random days where I just miss you more than I should
Hocus Pocus
When you have pinch marks all on your thighs
Not feeling school in the morning
I just wanna go for a night drive, talk and vibe with someone..
My stomach hurts so bad, I just want cuddles
Things are great one minute the next God knows what tf happen..
I'm so annoyed, I'm hurting, I'm aggravated, I'm stressed, I'm disappointed. So many feelings
I'm literally in tears at work.. Never been this stressed

I'm so drained

Praying for better days..
I'm annoyed af
I want this class too be over already and I've only been here for a half hour.. Fml
Can't even help but too laugh at this point.. My life's a joke
I'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing that I have such a good heart.. Fucks you over in the end
What's worse? Looking jealous or crazy..
Do I wanna go to school after work? No. Will I? Probably if I don't wanna fail.
There's really nothing I hate more than the word retard.. Nothing makes me more mad tbh
The noise of everyday communication takes center stage today w... More for Libra https://t.co/GzH7S5Zg3D
Praying for a good day though with a positive mindset! #goodmorning
one client is hitting/pulling every clients here, the other one is putting his hands in his pants &amp; ripping his diaper apart, ones yellin
It's gonna be a long day
Work till 3 then school till 7
I just want cuddles and a long talk with someone
Don't send mixed signals. That shits annoying
Tiffany said "don't mess anything up with him" and I'm just like wtf could possibly go wrong. Wtf is there
I'm better off just keep my mouth shut tbh lol
@asap_natedog @kylierose_x3 , and regardless what I did, when they both needed me I was there. Always
@asap_natedog @kylierose_x3 , lol I used to blow them off for a boy?
@asap_natedog @kylierose_x3 , and neither of y'all are seeing our point of view. but okay Nathan. Enjoy your night
@asap_natedog @kylierose_x3 , she does is constantly!! If One of her "best friends" needed her, she "can't" hangout. That's all I'm saying
@asap_natedog @kylierose_x3 , , A general status which made yall feel some type of way lol but have yourself a good night. Goodluck to y'all
@asap_natedog @kylierose_x3 , went all the way up until the day of &amp; completely ignored my text. Instead of saying she didn't want to come.
@asap_natedog @kylierose_x3 , Lol you said I'm corny because I said I needed new friends? Ave blew me off for plans we had for over a week
I'd be dammed if I let my boyfriend talk shit to my " best friends " when we argue but lol
If I tell you I like you just know it took every bit of courage I have.. How insecure I am &amp;always thinking there's someone better than me
There's just so many things I don't understand lately
Just something about late night drives.. My favorite
@allysonn_x3 , yess!!!! Or they're talking to their classmate while the professor's talking.. So annoying. Paying attention is key  lmao
@allysonn_x3 , like pleaseeeeee shut up. I wanna get outta class early but I can't if you don't stop with your questions
I can't believe I stayed around that damn long
Can't help but wait till you see that with me it ain't the same
There's always that one person in your class who never stops asking questions after it's been repeated 10 different times.
I will literally fight for someone or something until I can't fight anymore
I wonder how people can give up so easy
One thing I miss about being with someone is cuddling up after work, talking about each other's days &amp; a million kisses
Shower then school until 9:30
I probably shouldn't of spent a 1,000 on a mattress because it's so comfortable and I don't ever want to get out of bed in the morning
How you gonna act like thattttt
Must be nice too have someone who loves you for sure, you never let em' go.
Tiffany and I came to a conclusion that if nobody wants to marry us someday, we'll just live together and be roommates in a big house
When even your boss knows you're a crazy driver
If you wanna stay? Stay. If you wanna go? Bye.
I really am just tired of trying for everyone lately.. To be completely honest.
I was FaceTiming Tiffany while I'm at work and this guy was just looking at me... Tiffany goes, "he wants me"
Why do I feel like this is all a joke... Lol
Oversized sweatshirt, boots and leggings.. Can't forget the fuzzy socks today
Miscommunication can create an awkward moment today, especiall... More for Libra https://t.co/GzH7S5Zg3D
When shit don't add up, subtract yourself
It's Wednesday! Halfway through the week
I just wanna stay in bed
One thing I can't stand is being lied to!!!!!! Just be honest
To love and be loved is probably one of the greatest feelings
Honestly!!! https://t.co/R0bPvukV8Z
I'm not a mind reader. If you like me, say it. If you don't, say it. If I made you mad, SAY IT. Speak up about how you feel
In 5 years, none of this will matter anymore
The last couple of months, everything has changed. But I believe it's all for a reason
I genuinely don't feel close to anyone anymore. But I know if I need someone, theres maybe two people I'd be able to hit up &amp;they'd be there

@kylierose_x3 , lmao sounds good K. Have a good night my bitch, see your face bright and early
@kylierose_x3 ,lmao it's all good K.. Is that even a thing? Idk but I'm gonna start using it
Every night I get woken up, every night I can't go back to sleep.
@Kadirov23 , for once you have a legitimate excuse rather than you were watching something .
Pleaseeee https://t.co/sidMmBvGan
I know you missssss me
@Kadirov23 better be doing something important since he don't like texting people back
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change..
Horrible night
Autumn Fest
When your coworker begs you too switch your shifts so you can work with them
I'm sooooo ready for a nap
I like when someone says I make things easier. They can't wait to see me. They miss me. Little things
@Kadirov23 , you better. But okieeeee lol
@Kadirov23 , are you coming home next weekend?! Well the weekend coming up lol
About to just go check out Autumn Fest after work, since I haven't been at all this weekend
My clients don't call me "Brittany" they call me Bernie or Whitney lmao

Grateful for the ones in my life who's never switched up on me since I've met this. S/O too the very few of y'all
Ridinnnn out with Tiffany
Attended my first AA meeting tonight &amp; I must say, I'm pretty amazed.

@SmokedOutSwag Oops, I mean PS4. You can also press share and shut it off while in the game.
@SmokedOutSwag So do I. Go to the options or stream setup on your PC and uncheck the display comments setting.
@SmokedOutSwag I've changed it before. Although, I can't remember how I did it lol
Breasticles
@SmokedOutSwag You won't see chat anymore though. So you may want to have PC handy in that case. I stream 2K14 matches.
@SmokedOutSwag I know what you are talking about. It should be the overlay. You just have to change the settings to remove it.
@SmokedOutSwag Are you talking about the PSN game streaming? We were playing DOA 5, dope as long as you are into fighting games.
CREAM CHEESE ON PIZZA THOUGH @lizlemonsquares

Sometimes it feels good not belonging to a political party. Seeing the tantrum from both sides is so fulfilling.
Raise it!
The one thing I don't agree with in this whole political story of the week. It seems pretty misogynistic. And that.....is not okay.
@Josh_Barber87 @DerekDoherty1 @Diogenes347 Barber gets it.
@Diogenes347 @DerekDoherty1 Texas isn't even a real place. :P
@Diogenes347 @DerekDoherty1 I've exhausted myself on this subject. There is never compromise. I just want to troll at this point.
@DerekDoherty1 @Diogenes347 Hobby Lobby isn't going to ruin the world because of their poor choice of insurance plan.
@DerekDoherty1 @Diogenes347 By starting a company and making them work 60 hours a week with no holidays? :P
@DerekDoherty1 @Diogenes347 Unfortunately that isn't that simple. We still have to protect the religious rights of our people as well.
@DerekDoherty1 @Diogenes347 Not close. If you work for Hobby Lobby. Don't opt in for their insurance plans. Go somewhere else. So simple!
@DerekDoherty1 @Diogenes347 Lets see your documentation sir. I'm going to need an intense history lesson on your religion too.
WHY DON'T THEY CARRY WIRE HANGERS!? You guys have your bases covered.
@DerekDoherty1 @Diogenes347 I also doubt your company lasts long paying 20 hours of overtime each week. :P
@DerekDoherty1 @Diogenes347 Who would want to work for you?
@DerekDoherty1 @Diogenes347 That would be discrimination. :P And thats fine if you want to only cover abortions. Gonna need them!
@DerekDoherty1 @Diogenes347 have the right to do it.
@DerekDoherty1 @Diogenes347 I'm not arguing against birth control. I'm not even saying I agree with what they are doing. I'm saying they----
@DerekDoherty1 @Diogenes347 that they like. In my opinion, they shouldn't have to offer it at all.
@DerekDoherty1 @Diogenes347 Not close. The owners of that company are people. And they should have the right to provide whatever coverage--
@DerekDoherty1 @Diogenes347 You can't be wrong in a dispute that is based off of opinions.
Why are we so upset? I hear the need for abortion clinics are on the rise. May need to build a few! We are creating jobs! :D
I'm having fun with this. :)
Just imagine all the applications for maternal leave they are going to get in like 4-5 months.
Does Hobby Lobby sell wire hangers?
Also @Josh_Barber87 is terrible at hockey.
On a more serious note. I really do need optical insurance lol At least before I turn 25 or develop chronic migraines.
My employer won't provide me with optical insurance. Stop controlling my life!
MAGIC BASKETBALL IS BACK!
@Diogenes347 Not even! They don't drive a crane around demolishing planned parenthood facilities.
@mattmendoza No lol
@Diogenes347 Then again, like I said. This is where the problem actually is. Not some owners who wanted to stay strong behind their beliefs.
Holy shit someone fucking gets it.
@Diogenes347 No ones is taking anything away from them. They just have to get it from other sources.
@Diogenes347 There are certain circumstances obviously. No one is going to suffer because of this occurrence. And if they do it is based --
@Diogenes347 My view. Is that they should have the choice to offer what policies they see fit. Since it is...you know, their company.
@Diogenes347 No, you are exaggerating my words to gain leverage. We are talking about offering birth control on a medical insurance plan.
@Diogenes347 Excuse me if I didn't understand that properly.
@Diogenes347 Obvious health and nature hazards are a different story and can't be thrown aside based off of Religion. Try again.
@Diogenes347 It's not like they are burning you on the cross. Get over it.
@Diogenes347 I am also disappointed in you. :P
@Diogenes347 You mean they let you live your life based off your religion? Please do tell me how poorly you are being treated.
@Diogenes347 a company as you see fit.
@Diogenes347 you keep talking as if your stance is the correct one when all it is a basic opinion. There is nothing immoral about running --
@Diogenes347 I could say the same about you. And they are very based on reality. You are just making a big deal out of nothing.
@Diogenes347 and even if it isn't then you can opt out of their medical plan and get your own.
@Diogenes347 But it can! So I don't have a choice but to work for Hobby Lobby for the next 40 years? My current employer. It totally is.
@Diogenes347 I am seriously not trolling you. Well a little at this point because I can care less. Since this won't affect me. Plus they won
@Diogenes347 You also called me stupid and naive as if my opinion/belief on the matter is inferior to yours.
Finally I can stop holding my breath. LETS GOOOOOOOOO FRANCEEEEEE.
@AndAberrant SWEET JESUS. IT IS ABOUT TIME!!!!!!!!!!!
For now on I'll just stay away from mainstream pizza places. Bleh.
@Diogenes347 We have a whole other problem all together on that subject. This isn't a trickle down effect.
@Diogenes347 No but taking shots at my character, yet again, makes you sound just like them.
Green tea is so much better than soda. D;
@Diogenes347 You have access to it still. Not through that employer. :P
@Diogenes347 As do you. :P And I am being dead serious.
Cargsloost y u do dis
So ugh.....LETS SCORE A FUCKING GOAL FRANCE.
Still no email. Darn.
The humidity thooooooooooooooo
Two 2nd round picks for Jason Kidd? I felt like their were so many seasoned coaches out there looking for a job.
@Diogenes347 It is when the government attempts to force them to comply with guidelines that contradict their religious beliefs.
@Diogenes347 I guess nobody can be happy unless everything is handed to them. Excuse me for believing that humans are independent.
@Diogenes347 Don't be poor! There are plenty of places to work. Besides, religion junkies are on the way out.
I am totally looking forward to watching the Blues play this coming season! Really hope they make a splash in free agency.
@Diogenes347 Or not make poor decisions.Like work for an outspoken religious company. Or we can just oppress the shit out of business owners
@Diogenes347 It isn't? Its telling you that you are shit out of luck if you think that are going to take care of you and that hooker. :P
@Diogenes347 They can what? Tell me to go get my own insurance plan? Set a bunch of gays on fire?
@Diogenes347 IM NOT GOING TO WORK FOR THAT COMPANY AMMAR. You keep denying and saying it is more complicated than that. It isn't.
@Diogenes347 I believe in the medical system in general.
@Diogenes347 But they aren't! I totally have access to them. I can call right now and get my own medical insurance plan!!!!!!
Some Christian churches actually smoke during sermons in non-legalized states.
@Diogenes347 What are they doing that is unethical? Without the use of a generalizing term. They don't want to pay for other birth control?
@Diogenes347 I don't think we are any further away than where we were. lol
@Diogenes347 Still no point there. I believe they should be able to regulate their company as they see fit. Simple as that.
@Diogenes347 What does that have to do with anything? Im not defending them on religious grounds. What does smoking pot have to do with it?
@Diogenes347 you've used a few phrases I didn't appreciate much. :P
@Diogenes347 But does it say they can't?
@Diogenes347 Why would I act out against something that I believe to be correct. Also calm yourself down.
@Diogenes347 But the system isn't fisting society?  Unless we are talking about the same shit that has been going on forever.
@Diogenes347 @lizlemonsquares So why is it your employers responsibility to take care of that?
@Diogenes347 @lizlemonsquares I can also just pay for my own healthcare.
@Diogenes347 @lizlemonsquares Employers should be able to provide whatever healthcare that they want. Even if that means they provide zero.
@Diogenes347 @lizlemonsquares Why can't it?
@Diogenes347 @lizlemonsquares No, but I'm not going to put myself in that position.
@lizlemonsquares Not a joke at all. Don't want to have a kid? Don't have sex, or pay for your own contraceptives.
I'm going to side with the Surpreme Court on this one. My workplace shouldn't have to pay to keep me from having a child.
I want that table :P
Seriously. Please email me back lol
YOU************
Email me back to stupid bitch.
I am so tired ughhhhhhh. Just take me back to my bed Lord.
@FrankatGomez :(
Ayeee http://t.co/jLFvUgI4sh
You could park a car between that thigh gap.
All by myself.  :(
Bored. :/
Gravity bonggggggg
I don't want to be awake
All I want right now are candy and pastries and chocolate milk.
Omg are you still sleeping?
@hollycheesecake we are about to leave, I'm not taking my phone with me. Lol see you soon.
@BRush_25 What are you heading to KC for? Coming to Lawrence?
I've been listening to @DonaldGlover tunes all day. This is your fault @hollycheesecake
@Diogenes347 Hmm.....he told me you both fucked it up lol I'm just teasing anyways. :P
Going to buy my first gravity bong tomorrow so @Diogenes347 can fuck up and spill it then ask me to jump his car! #Getanewalternator
I am so ready to be off and home! Can't wait to start this weekend!
@SmokedOutSwag Phew!
@SmokedOutSwag What
Even more so for building deck lists.
One of my absolute favorite things to do is play magic.
So much poop.
It's Rex Manning day!!!!!
I wonder if I'll be held responsible for this?
Baeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
@hollycheesecake I DON'T WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH HER GEEZ.
@hollycheesecake That isn't necessary lol
@hollycheesecake hush
\"Your ex, quite possibly the best girl to make a bad decision with.\" lol
Ex being the best option for a booty call? As much as I don't want to go there it does make sense.
@Diogenes347 They are just bigots.
@Diogenes347 It is, those are the people that don't appreciate the sport itself but more the glory they get from their team winning.
@Diogenes347 They simply are not a true sports fan.
That game was well played by boths sides.
I want Chipotle ugh
@Diogenes347 wat! Don't worry. I have no problem kicking some Christian ass.
WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY DOES EVERYONE IN FRONT OF ME HAVE TO BE THE SLOWEST PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING UNIVERSE?
Morning everyone!  Let's hope this day doesn't shit on me.
@hollycheesecake why wouldn't I? I'M SINGLE AND READY TO MINGLE.
@hollycheesecake Sounds like my kind of guy. :) Can't wait til I get divorced.  So then I can have angry divorced people sex.
@hollycheesecake is he hot
@hollycheesecake what. I want to be youtube famous
Time to go home!
Ugh I am so poor.
@lizlemonsquares *Friday
@hollycheesecake Oh Jesus it has been forever. I guess it all depends on the ticket prices of both shows.

Rise Against, Touche Amore, and Radkey. Me likeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Totally going to see Rise Against in Sept.
I found some great furniture today. Now if only I had the money to buy it all. #Poorpeopleproblems
Holding on to a small glimmer of hope is exhausting.
HOUSTON!?
LB James is now a free agent. Where is he going? LA? Dallas? Boston? Back to the Heat again?
Filling out paperwork in the morning is perfect. Later on in the day when I wake up? Fuck that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@lizlemonsquares Do I need to grab a ticket or do I just stand here?
I don't could ever utilize the word session when it comes to smoking. Seems too cliche to me and dorky as well. To each his own though.
I SERVE NO PURPOSE.
@hollycheesecake Social media, on the other hand is a poor choice for a place to vent what you are feeling. Although it depends on who u are
@TheBasedGodNick get wrecked little girl
@hollycheesecake That is true. But for the most part social media has been the best thing for people looking to express themselves.
So I realized that SCG KC is at the end of this month and I have done literally nothing to prepare. Looks like I am winning this one.
@hollycheesecake explain.........
@hollycheesecake So the answer would be yes.
Ladies, do you consider staying at home with a guy watching movies a date? Why or Why not?
I would be so much happier if I wasn't aware of all the shit I need/want to do.
High school reunions are terrible. If I didn't care enough to keep in touch after HS then I definitely don't care ten years later.
Then why do I always pick the path that says no? I am literally my own worst enemy.
What kind of person am I? God basically laid out two paths in front of me. One says \"Yes\" other says \"No\". Seems easy right? Cont...
That's spot on #noimnotsubtweeting http://t.co/tfJ2wdClGG
I despise the thought of waking up at 5am every morning. On the other hand, I adore the consequences of doing so. #Letsgo #MTGFitness
Why has the website of one of the biggest companies in the world been fucking up since 8am? #Frustrated
UGH
Trying to put in this application is fucking terrible. No way I can have it done by today if your fucking website is down.
Need another hair cut. Might also be time to clean all this hair off my face too. lol
If you think you are a pretty unique and open minded individual just go look at one of my music playlists.
80'S were the best time for music. No contest.
https://t.co/IDWwC2IVb8\nGET IT GURLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
@hollycheesecake What table?
I am such a pest.
And whatever else I can get a hold of in the future.
The old unused dining room is now going to be the room used for retro gaming. N64, Gamecube, PS2, Xbox.
Really need some sort of long or tall Book shelf for stacking game consoles on. As well as a coffee table and a few end tables.
Trying to get things for the house is such a pain in my ass. I've basically cleared out the dining room. Now missing necessary pieces.
http://t.co/Z4YXMpgNqc\nHe's got me wet. lol
I'm going to get everything I want.
Work, home, sleep, work. Work, work, work, work. WORKWORKWORKWORKWORKWORK
Crossing my fingers for great things in my future.

Playing around in the dining room today.
So, I've never seen West side story. Who wants to come over and help me change that?
I wake up every day like I have to go to work. I have failed myself.
Passed out on the couch last night.
@TacoBell is BAE

No one has ever bought me a light up dress before. :(
That is some damn good tea.
Shit it's almost 9? wasted a whole day. Sad actually.
You're ohana. Ohana means family. Family means no one gets left behind.
I have been informed that jhorts give me an erection. #Themoreyouknow
I really should have been more productive today........oh well. :)

GODZILLA SAKE WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE.
Way to go Costa rica! Well played the whole match! #Brazil2014
I really don't care though.
Dude my dad is so mad.

@Diogenes347 @hollycheesecake Come on bae, lets go try some foreplay using each others smegma............in private. &gt;.&gt;
@hollycheesecake @Diogenes347 Ammar is bae now.
@Diogenes347 You can be my bae and come to the Blues/Stars game. &lt;3&lt;3
@AndAberrant I usually have the volume off anyways so I can listen to the buzz. :P
@AndAberrant Can't beat high quality free streams :P
@AndAberrant How fluent are you in Spanish? :P http://t.co/UFOLI0CIwQ
@AndAberrant :3
@AndAberrant Can't watch it?
Oh look, one package today. That means this day is going to be torture.
I've been seriously pondering the idea of gauging my ears. I should really make a career choice beforehand. Anyways, thoughts?
From now on the only fucking pet I am owning is a cat. Because cats are way cooler and low maintenance.
The Sound of Music is also being performed at Starlight Theater at the end of July.
I am long overdue for a trip to Nelson @nelson_atkins
When is Motaku?
This is now where I totally forget.
Alright. Plans made 3 months in advance. So 3 months to find a date for 9/27. How hard could it be? lol
@lizlemonsquares eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
I'm running off to live with the hippies. No you can't come so don't ask.
ANYONE WANT TO PLAY BASKETBALL SUPER EARLY?
So what am I going to do this weekend that is free, has me surrounded by people, and is actually fun and interesting.
Cheers to me dying from dehydration.
SHIT I NEED A WATER BOTTLE. AND A HOLDER
I need to come up with a half decent playlist for bike riding. Any recommendations? @Diogenes347
That means I get to spend an excessive amount to time not tending to his high maintenance ass.
I also dropped Billy off back at my sisters for good. Since my dad finally moved in to his new house.
And thats it!
Like.....yeah if you were such a shitty boyfriend that I now just want to eat pooter.
So one of my best friends that I ended up turning down a long long time ago is now a lesbian. Glad I didn't have to be that guy.
All the shit I can buy with money will totally bring me happiness. :P
I want to get married to a rich unfaithful woman so she can have affairs and pay me to not give a fuck.
Can't wait to watch France play today!!!!!!
Apparently my fly has been down all morning. Cool.
My only goal in life is to say a prayer to Jesus and hope that one day I wake up as snoop dogg.
Hell even KC. :o
Can we just move to Manhattan now? Or Lawrence?
Up 2 hours early today. Ugh.
So what am I doing this weekend? I basically need to find something to do that gives me a high chance of having a near death experience.
Nopenopenopenopenopenopenope
All I need in life is my blanket. Everything else I can do without. Except maybe this bong.
:(
GG ENGLAND. ITS GONNA STING WATCHING US YANKS PLAY IN THE ELIMINATION ROUNDS.
@dirtyslovak Right? Uruguay has caught some breaks.
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL

@PersianPrepster @MattWalshBlog This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. How did you find it?
What a fucking goal. Way to go England.
@bmkibler DONE
Don't know what to do with myself right now.  Probably work but whatever. SOME TEXT ME I AM SO EXCITED.
blaze it
@lizlemonsquares I am 100% percent sure that is not true.
The Expendables 3 Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Sylvester Stallone Movie HD: http://t.co/ss3gjkEyhj via @YouTube I'm moist.
I shouldn't be so reserved with people when I first meet them. I put myself into so many awkward situations.
I doubt I'll watch many world cup games today. Spain vs. Chile is the only one that seems interesting.
AYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Girls always fighting over the wrong dudes. If this dude is juggling women around then why the hell do you want him? :PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP

I'm really not sure what is better to watch while blazed. Bob Ross painting, or Microcosmos.
Great night for a walk. #Olathe #poop http://t.co/5m81DM5HiM
@SmokedOutSwag Hopefully that performance got the rest of the guys energized going forward. I truly believe Mexico can go far.
Let's hope I get home just in time to start up the Russia, Croatia, game.
@SmokedOutSwag My heart was going dude. Ochoa was on fire. Mexico did a great job turning it around that second half.
@SmokedOutSwag Right? After that first half I was almost certain Brazil was destined to take that game.
Thank God for Ochoa. #Brazil2014 GREAT JOB MEXICO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@dirtyslovak You are using Univision as well? lol
A BREAKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
sometimes the camera angle makes me shit myself.
I AM GOING TO DIE FROM SUSPENSE AND THIS ISN'T EVEN MY HOME COUNTRY.
LETS GO!!!!!#Brazil2014
Bullshit yellow card.
Mexico is looking way better this half. Looks like the roles have reversed. Lets go Mexico! #Brazil2014
MEXXXICOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! THAT SAVEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!! #Brazil2014
That shot was beautiful, but that save was even better. #Brazil2014
@lizlemonsquares Stop these shenanigans!!!!!!
Brazil's aggressive attack is ridiculous. I expect a goal within the next 10 minutes of play.
Mexico looks sloppy. It's hard to believe the game is still tied.
That was close
@lizlemonsquares o bby
Aside from some great soccer, this day has been terrible.
BRING ON THIS NEXT GAME ALREADY!!!!
DAT SAVE
GOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLLLL! LETS GO BELGIUM!
Ready for the Mexico/Brazil game to start!
ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
@lizlemonsquares OMG I FINALLY KNOW WHAT TO WATCH I LOVE THAT MOVIE
@SmokedOutSwag I guess you never miss a second. loooooooooolllllllllllllllllll
@SmokedOutSwag Where the hell are you?
Vampire Weekend #Ifeelitinmyboner
@lizlemonsquares Sorry, I'll try to remember to not be so sexy while you have a sun burn.
I don't care how his name is actually pronounced I am always going to call him (Pepe) Pee Pee.
Can we make this official so I can put you as my phone background and not feel weird? LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
@swish41 YOU WOULD SAY THAT! Great work by your guys!
I'm pretty sure you know you are in love when you are prepared to deal with all the crazy just to be with or around them.
@lizlemonsquares What else am I supposed to do on twitter while I'm at work? :P
I JUST WANT TO SEE IGGY'S ASS NOT VISIT YOUR STUPID AD FILLED WEBSITE!
Room for more on this #TeamGermany bandwagon? That game was ridiculous.

Incredibly frustrated. I feel like I am doing everything right. I guess not. It is me after all.

Lie sigh
Ohhhhhhh. El Scorcho. #listenlonger
@iamSB3 Right? Chick is gorgeous without all the makeup on.
@AndAberrant Like not being able to get tickets!?!? :P
That rhymed and I don't like it.
The internet is a terrible place. Quit throwing all these beautiful women up in my face! :P
@lizlemonsquares I would have gone but I already had plans that I was already running late for. :\\
@lizlemonsquares I can imagine you moping through the office dragging a coffee filled IV. How was the show?
@DerekDoherty1 If only the United States ever had a chance.
My #wcw http://t.co/DKy7TaXZDy
Why didn't I eat breakfast? Someone help.
There were no more donuts. ;-;
How much longer can I resist going into the office and getting a donut?
Such a terrible sight investing so much in something so hopeless.
@Diogenes347 @lizlemonsquares I love you dad.

@Josh_Barber87 good. bitch.
@Josh_Barber87 I'm just saying lol
@Josh_Barber87 He is just a closed minded fuck from an era clouded with ignorance. I could really care less what he thinks.

@lizlemonsquares Well deserved.
@Diogenes347 I'm home if you get done running errands and want to hang for a bit.
Guy Armageddons and then loses. Lol
Just won a cube draft with a janky ass jund deck.
Ugh. I feel terrible today.
Last required AA meeting is over with.
All the titties
Titties
@lizlemonsquares That is why I am planning to steal him.
\"@TheBovsWho: thought this was interesting http://t.co/lXE3RDlUsR\" WHY AM I DOING THIS TODAY. UGH LOL
@Diogenes347 Always covering all the bases pops.
@Diogenes347 I love you Dad.
My head is spinning so fast today. I really need to stop being a fuck up.
@hollycheesecake Sometimes anonymity is a blessing kiddo.
Alcoholics Anonymous romance perhaps?
Sweet jesus she was beautiful.
Netflix and AA all day.
Super dead and home from the PTQ. 4/20 blaze it.
@lizlemonsquares Foxxxxxyyyyy lady
The internet is a terrible place and now I have an erection.
What is going on after 7pm?
So friggin tired. Just let me be off work so I can do things.
Last day of the work week! Lets goooooooooo.
What a lovely day to spend at AA. Lol
@hollycheesecake That sounds awesome! :) Win me money.
@hollycheesecake Nothing. :P What are you up to?
@hollycheesecake hnnnnnggggggg

@hollycheesecake @Josh_Barber87 No nerds aloud. Nerd.
@ChannelFireball I just wanted to give a shout out to you guys! What a great service. I ordered my cards Monday morning. Got them today!
@Josh_Barber87 @hollycheesecake I'M GONNA DO THAT STUFF
@Josh_Barber87 @hollycheesecake MEH. BUT I'LL DO OTHER THINGS
@Josh_Barber87 @hollycheesecake You guys suck! I guess I'll just have to watch all by muhsalf
@Josh_Barber87 @hollycheesecake Are you still home? lol I thought you were getting off early to chill with your cousin?
Making changes to my Modern deck is such a pain in the ass. KC's meta is always a huge question mark.
Who has 2k14 and a PS4?
WHO WANTS TO COME CUDDLE WITH ME AND WATCH GAME OF THRONES ALL NIGHT? No one? Alright.
@hollycheesecake http://t.co/wFXNoqJIHL

Reporter Fired For Saying He'd F*ck Missing Woman: http://t.co/95VbLKGbC7 WHERE IT ALL STARTED.
MUWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAGAHAHAHAHA.  New shower curtain! http://t.co/U9yPIshsQh
It's here............ http://t.co/rApCoD56rD
@mattmendoza I'll explain further later on if you are interested.
@mattmendoza This is a mystery.  The decks and the players are out there. I think players just see Win - A - Boxes as bad value.
@mattmendoza And around 20 ish games.
@mattmendoza That is sort of what I'm getting at. I could pay in $1500 to build myself a modern deck. Or I could buy myself a new PS4.
@mattmendoza I'll give it a look! Moderns popularity wouldn't be so overhyped if the cards weren't unreasonably priced.
@mattmendoza What is Coup?
@SamPrososki @YouTube Seriously crying because I'm laughing so hard
@SamPrososki Waking up to a text asking if you can work and ignoring it is a great way to start the day though.
Just ordered the cards to finished another few pauper decks.
Shittttttttttt
ima cry
How the hell am I going to make it through this day.
@lizlemonsquares U......G.........H
2-1 in the DE. Deck is pretty good. Just had some weird draws.
Playing the Theros Block Sealed Daily. Excited as fuck to play with JOU,
Those are some dangerous legs.
So if Mark Jackson is against being homosexual can we give him a ban as well? It seems fitting.
Getting knocked out of the Conference Finals leaves a bitter taste in my mouth today. I wish this stuff wouldn't pop up in my news feed.
Who is off today and wants to hang for a bit. I'll be back out in Johnson County here is a few hours.
@lizlemonsquares You don't even have a Rodney in your house yet. STEP YOUR GAME UP.
@lizlemonsquares sucks to suck poopy butt
Put that in the dishwasher when you are finished #becauseitsacup
This must be just like living in paradise!
And I don't want to go hooooome!
It is a sad day.
If Goofy can find the girl of his dreams then  so can I!!!!!

@lizlemonsquares MISTAKESSSS
Days like these I wish I lived in STL. Would love to see an Ivory Coast game.
Song of Blood is suchhhhhhhhhhhh a good card.
@SmokedOutSwag Terrible music. Even if it was good music, terrible people. Environment etc.
I stopped arguing that a long time ago. People will do as they please and arguing only creates unwanted stress for nothing.

@lizlemonsquares If I could wear basketball shorts and a T-shirt every day I would lol
@lizlemonsquares ETHAN DOES I SEENT IT, Damon too lol
@lizlemonsquares NO POLOS ALLOWEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Buy me Chipotle so I know it's real.
I think if I wanted to go on a first date. I would like for it to be the most down to earth date ever. No make up, no dresssing up.
MUFASA IS NOT GETTING UP SIMBA. ;-;
\"@RealTalk: this wedding dress is perfection http://t.co/f51MtspUT6\" This is pretty gay but I would love for my future wife to wear this.
Going to stay at my Dad's from Friday until Wednesday. It's gonna be great. Not.
So done with today, tomorrow. And most of the weekend really.
@FrankatGomez Gene Simmons is a fucking tool
I have the best mom ever! Omgggggggg
Yet again I can't wait to get home. I just want to be together with my bed. :)

@hollycheesecake Probably not but ok.
My favorite part about social media is that now everyone thinks they are Ghandi or Martin Luther King. No one cares about your stupid quotes
I guess I hit 5k tweets at some point. Totally missed it. Awesome though!
Take off your shirt.
Take off your shirt.
@SmokedOutSwag Life lol
Bored, tired, stressed.
Time to hook up this stereo for some music.
Who wants to run away and live with the hippies?
I just want someone to cuddle with right now.
So excited for Ibaka to return tonight!!!
@Chris_VanMeter @Gfabs5 Please tell me you guys brought some utensils to shave before the Legacy open.
Totally got lost on my way home. Now I'm at Panchos. Yay me.
@FRESHYak98 I just want one so it can be modded.
@FRESHYak98 not sure yet. I would have to figure out the process first.
@FRESHYak98 lol I don't want the one at his house :P
@FRESHYak98 wanna get rid of them? I want to learn how to fix them. :P unless you already have plans for them.
@FRESHYak98 Do you still have broken Xbox 360 ' s laying around?
@lizlemonsquares I love it when you call me names! :D
@lizlemonsquares nooooooo come back
This is totally appropriate for #throwbackthursday https://t.co/85yFrCcdHq
@ashleyLohuis TEACH ME YOUR WAYS
@NHL #NHL15Oshie Master of the shootout!
Oh hey look. It's National Crush day. How do you celebrate this holiday? Confess to them? Lol That's not happening.
I wonder if I sent a message/email/letter/call to every female friend I have ever had confessing my love. What would their reactions be?
Back on that AA grind.
Remember that one time @hollycheesecake puked all over my floor? Pepperidge Farm remembers.
@lizlemonsquares You could just pretend you are some sort of crustacean. :)
@lizlemonsquares I would disagree. :P
Plus, it's Lawrence. I mean C'mon!
Really hope I get to move to Lawrence at the end of the year instead of Manhattan. Would be so awesome to stay close to friends.
Sitting here waiting for AA to start. Getting shit done.
@hollycheesecake brt
@hollycheesecake me too. So I can come to your house and read all your books.
@StLouisBlues @OSH74 How about a retweet so we can get some more #NHL15Oshie going around! The more the better! LGB!
Am I the only one who has issues with watching movies with a large group of people?
@SmokedOutSwag I see what you did there.
@SmokedOutSwag To me it's like Soccer in the sense that u get a ton of excitement and suspense from the minimal scoring, with some brutality
@SmokedOutSwag The sport is awesome. Don't really know why I hadn't got into it sooner.
@SmokedOutSwag I've been watching for the past two years. I'm pretty good at NHL now.
@SmokedOutSwag No you spelled it wrong!
@SmokedOutSwag Kane is definitely good. But doesn't necessarily deserve to be on the cover more than any other guy. Just tweet #NHL15Oshie
#NHL15Oshie
Damn, how can I sit through two hours of people taking about problems I don't have if I can't even stand the sound of my fan. #TheStruggle
@SmokedOutSwag Lol It's all good. I just assumed it was a joke otherwise.
@SmokedOutSwag My headache suddenly went away! Weird....Guess I'm good now lol
I mean like....just come over and watch whatever you want. Surf Tumblr w/e. Just let me lay on your lap while you scratch my head. lol
@hollycheesecake Damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn gurrrrrllllllllllllllllll
Have this headache brewing. Don't know why. Someone come and comfort me. lol
@hollycheesecake I think it is weird that you notice these things. :P
@hollycheesecake You probably cried. No need to put on a face! :)
@hollycheesecake I don't know what that means but just because it sucked for you doesn't mean I can't laugh about it!
From now on until it becomes unnecessary. I will use #NHL15Oshie on every tweet!
@hollycheesecake About time people start calling your ignorant ass out!
So instead of biking. Would anyone be interested in sporting it up after I get home from AA? Football, Basketball? Hmm?
Attending my first AA meeting tonight. Times to set things straight!
\"Excuse me ma'am! Would you mind taking a picture of my boyfriend and I shoving each others tongues down our throats.?\"
Everyone make sure they don't drop that thun thun thun today!
@TheNickMarriott No not those!
Day or night. Click it or tick it.
Forgot my headphones again. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.
What the hell is wrong with you people?

@Glitter_Bitch_ stupid that person got  a ton of hype
Social media really does play 99% of people's lives #fucked
@Glitter_Bitch_ fact

The only thing in my timeline was this dress being black and blue or white and gold. Who gives a fuck what the fucking color was
@wahoO_O idk man. I don't think any team in the league can fuck with the cavs in a 7 game series
@wahoO_O cavs okc would be dope. Unless Dallas does some fuck shit again
@wahoO_O they better hope not. But honestly idk what team can take the cavs in a 7 game series. The Hawks lose first around every year
@wahoO_O fact. This season the west looking like the east for the past 6 years
@wahoO_O  what's the real thoughts on okc with out durant? Playoffs or no cause this suns okc game is making me think their not
How does okc look in the playoffs if they're neck and neck with the Suns?
Good to see all the people talking shit on the cavs sucking their dick after they've been killin the game. #championships
Derrick rose is done again. #derrickwho

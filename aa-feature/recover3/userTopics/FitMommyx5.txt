@forever_damaged I def understand TRUST ME!! I have so many reasons to get better but my brain can't or won't rationalize it!
@forever_damaged I'm only asking cause I'm 30+ years into ed and there are days I want recovery and days I look in the mirror and just can't
@forever_damaged do you WANT to get better?
I've had nothing to eat all day... But I burnt a ton of cals.... (In bed)

Omg I can't even believe how happy I am!!!

@brokenl0gic week plus worth in 2 days .. Then drank... Deadly
@brokenl0gic than was recommended I thought it was just like Tylenol but it's not... I took way more than I should have in 2 days I took a
@brokenl0gic yes it was they could tell by the concentration of the drug in my system sadly I couldn't read the small print I took more
@brokenl0gic ya it's just going to fuck everything up about getting my kids back !!!
@breatheslowly_ trust me it will!!!
I feel shitty but I'm apparently fine but a drink or Tylenol will kill me so I'm going to be careful and going to my aa meeting shortly
@brokenl0gic accidental OD of cold meds then booze I relapsed after 2 months and 2 days sober
@breatheslowly_ I'd be lying dead here on my couch right now.  Nobody would have come looking for me... It's pretty scary!
@breatheslowly_ that's why my fever never went away then I relapsed and drank Friday night had I not gone to my aa meeting sat morning
@breatheslowly_ I guess they sent me home it was an accidental OD I was taking Tylenol cold and flu night every 3 hours I had strep throat
And other iv's fml and still puffy from the mess they give you to bring you back from the dead  https://t.co/Htr7IWq4rY

AA meeting was awesome today!! 2 days till I'm 2 months sober! Yay!
Nobody should be that afraid of their dr's or their colleges yet I am 
To actually see what's wrong I've been spiking a massive fever daily but the thought of up there terrifies me
And once strep gets in your blood stream your a gonner I can barely swallow my own spit without crying but this hospital scares me to much
My newest problem is my throat... My very close and dear friend died of strep I think I've had strep throat for 2 weeks no purging-
Sad for the over 8 ppl that unfollowers me. My lessons are golden and 4 me lived and learned
$$$ means nothing unless YOUR HAPPY  I'm not happy
-stop giving my will and life over to this \"higher power\" and just enjoy the 300k on drugs and booze I wanna give up some days
You know you have good days and bad. I'm in a deep dark place I see the light I just can't get there in time . I often wonder should I -
@breatheslowly_ every time I take a antibiotic I'm potentially killing myself taking it to save myself how do you rationalize that ??
@breatheslowly_ but thank you I'm also terrified of taking antibiotics cause I've had c diff and don't want that hell again
@breatheslowly_ small town bs
@breatheslowly_ they don't see me as sick they see me as \"SICK\"
So to go up there as a recovering \"drunk\" could really set me back not going could kill me like it did my friend
I can't go anywhere but the cities er I get treated like a crazy person literally there is a red flag that I've seen on my name
Is pushing my limits. I know it's a test but I fear I'll fail. I've not drank but maybe this is my punishment for when I did?
Pretty sure I have strep throat,, my bf died cause he ignored it so far I'm ignoring it... I have nothing to live for my higher power
@simpsonrob39 you learned SHIT!!!!
@simpsonrob39 you one of those freaks that goes to meetings to meeting to meet hotties GET THE FUCK OVER YOURSELF or get to a meeting!!
@simpsonrob39 guessing The Lord gave you the strength to to drink all the wine and yet you hide behind the things you cannot change

@SSkinny_Love98 wasn't talking about me.. My friend Aimee Moore that was on dr Phil
Won't see 2017 and that inspires me to get better I really don't want to die!! And especially because of my own actions. I'm choosing life!!
@SSkinny_Love9 literally so small her teeth don't fit in her mouth I almost lost her last year and she cut me out of her life I know she
@SSkinny_Love98 this is what she looked like years ago now her teeth are sticking out of her mouth cause she's she's https://t.co/1JYQFcmTgN

@depressionisme3 bulimia
@breatheslowly_ there wasn't a name for what I had back then I was treated with shock therapy, isolation therapy. It was awful! Feel blessed
@breatheslowly_ where even there they had no clue what to do with me! I've been misdiagnosed so many times it would make your head spin!
@breatheslowly_ feel blessed in a way that in your era ppl are talking about it! I was just just just shipped off to a mental ward -
@breatheslowly_ I'm 41 and had ed since I was 8 there wasn't social media I thought I WAS THE ONLY ONE!! I thought I was fucking nuts !

Eating disorder due to the fact that the body is never sure if or when it will get fed and if it does purging or laxing will rid the food
Eating disorder due to the fact that the body is never sure if or when it will get fed and if it does purging or laxing will rid the food
This was my first in town ed buddy and she is going to die and I'm scared cause we both have EDNOS which is proven to be the most deadly-
Her thighhap looked like a rainbow it was huge her legs were so tiny it actually scared me her teeth don't even fit into her mouth 
@breatheslowly_ do you have an iPhone or a ereader of any kind it's very cheap!!
@breatheslowly_ crap!
If you google her name and dr Phil you'll see she's from stratford like me... https://t.co/dl55o8yfDJ

Until of course he runs to store for protection cause I won't give in without it then I'll truly be fucked (pun intended)
Ok so ya I thought it out I do want him but decided he can't have me without a condom he's not a protect kinda guy so I'll keep legs locked
He's also driving hours not min to see me this is either our true love coming thru or forever friends I'm happy with either x
To sooth and love me unconditionally doesn't that count for a shit ton?? I think it does he wants to come hold me and sooth me that counts!
This is our 3rd try if it doesn't work like b ball he's out for loves sake I gotta try I've always loved him and he's coming here-
My current best friend/fuck buddy is mad I thought he could handle this but he's to young to understand he belongs to me and always has
I'm being pulled if not ripped in 2 directions my x from over 20 years ago my 1st love is coming tomorrow I should be happy right??!!

@FacingBrooke thanks for being my rock it's meant more than you'll ever know 
@FacingBrooke love you again as I said and if my wifi gives out happy new year xx
@FacingBrooke but I won't drink ever again feeling is really healing I've learned that the very hard but best way it works xx
@FacingBrooke being sober and honest with myself is the only way I'll ever heal truly.. And we all need that I still take my meds
@FacingBrooke I'm always going to be sober now!! Being drunk was a false way of dealing with my losses and my early year abuse..
@TimHortons a human he's made bad choices or got a raw deal in life but nobody cared he was hurt but me?? Ppl are heartless and cold I cared
@TimHortons to the older gentleman and asked if he was ok he was not responsive so I called 911 and stayed till I knew he was ok he's
@TimHortons other day and an obvious user took a very nasty fall there were many on lookers some laughed most walked away... I went over

@FacingBrooke I was purposely eating in front of the workers cause they knew about my ed so it's kinda blown up since then
@FacingBrooke Tuesday is pizza day here xx that's all Harrison will eat and Tuesday is one of my visit days
There are lives real ppl that depend on me getting my shit together! I even had to \"postpone\" my tummy tuck cause my babies are #1
I've got bigger Demond's to fight atm I can't be in control of food input and output even if it is slowly making me crazy..
My ed on the other hand is taking the hardest blow I've eaten starved binged purged I'm a total FATASS mess... I'll work on that later..
Another sober day and I give thanks to myself today for that... Christmas alone was truly awful I sugarcoat things at times but I'm here 
@FacingBrooke hope you had a good Christmas xx
@FacingBrooke I know you watch me xx and I love u for it thank u xx 
I'm going through a big life change I've lost my kids I'm sober and I left my husband so plz don't leave me too xx
I know it's been I while since I told you all how much I love you and need you!! So plz don't leave me!! Like all my \"friends\"
Right my wrongs forgive my trespasses as I forgive others it's not crazy I just don't believe in god I just need a higher power so she's it!
Oh in case your wondering about the \"higher power \" thing I've decided it's my mom... Why not right she's \"up\" there so I'll ask here to

@ezekielmechanik I am predicting fury.
Every TV series that lasts more than 2 series sadly, will jump the shark and episode 18 of series 6 in The Sopranos is a prime example.

Any day Chelsea win a trophy is a dark day for humanity, enlightened only by the risibility of John Terry's existence. A telex of a human.
My uncle was in showbiz. \"Always leave em hungry for more\", he said. Nothing to do with his job, he was an sadist who malnourished his kids.

In tribute Moyes not taking MUFC questions, Rolling Stones' next gig will consist entirely of songs from Dirty Work and Bridges To Babylon.
The Catholic Church can start giving Bowie grief when they've made such great albums. Like Tin Machine, Tin Machine II and Oy Vey Baby.
'Moves Like Jagger' was originally released as 'Moves Like Vader', but to mixed reviews. And an injunction from Lucasfilm. #FACHT

@nchiz7 I've found another picture of Moyes being told the news:  http://t.co/l6JoDFGq74
Space permits making that seem less harsh, but the point is that he is not a winner. And that club now demands victory.
Looking like a done deal, but I'd still be flabbergasted if Moyes is new MUFC boss. Replace Britain's most successful with a loser like him?

@TheNairnDon Certainly was. \"Premier Inn, please\"\n\"What one?\"\n\"How many is there?\"\n\"Four\"\nHe didn't even bother with his fare after the 3rd.
In my adult life, I was once thrown out of a pub in Manchester for breakdancing. That is a time I do not recollect quite so fondly.
I won a toy fire engine for breakdancing once. It was the early 80s. So cool. No birthday party ever since has even came close to that one.

By default, it'll be an improvement on the American-Jamaican mismatched police duo TV pilot 'Starsky and Dutchie'. That was a bloody farce.

After listening to 'No Line On The Horizon' for a few weeks now, I'm convinced it's a masterpiece. It's their best album since Achtung Baby.
After hearing 'Get On Your Boots', which still remains their worst song, I avoided listening to the U2 album that it came from. But after...

@Orange_Monkey Wow. Well, that's me not getting anything done for the rest of the night. I absolutely love stuff like that. Many thanks.
@Orange_Monkey Thank you! That looks an interesting website as well. I particularly enjoyed your intro pod about the history of the nasties.
@DD621 Wasn't feeling Happy Feet, I found it very irritating. The babby wasn't really into it either. Same goes for the sequel as well.

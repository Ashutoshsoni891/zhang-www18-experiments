LET THIS SINK IN. DIRECT QUOTE FROM MR. MANDELLA http://t.co/IZh7AHaYoB
This has escalated too far. @GainsMandella will be blocked for 12 hours.
@GainsMandella @ScottMigliore9 @PedroYoungblood sent it to me
George is just mad that a mass snapchat was sent of him making love to himself in the shower.
@GainsMandella @Ryan_Bourgeois why would it matter if he tweeted from a personal account? That's why we have multiple, dumbass!
@Double_E72 @GainsMandella calm down. There is no reason for impeachment
We would also like you to know that he was caught masturbating on spring break by @ScottMigliore9
The league would like you to know that george Mandella is a piece of shit
@GainsMandella your comments still fall under slander
@GainsMandella as of right now, your conducts fall in the legal realm of defamation and slander. You can be sued
@GainsMandella impeachment is a very strong accusation. There must be evidence for these statements
@GainsMandella you are to be blocked from the league's twitter shortly. Please fall in line with the league's conduct policy.
League Right Now http://t.co/phxaY0tDAE
@scanseco42 you are walking a tight rope
@scanseco42 please wastage the commissioner. Evidence will only be accepted if it can be authenticated.
@scanseco42 there has been no evidence of that Mr. Canseco.
Evidence to prove that Mr. Couture deserved his warning. http://t.co/RderUWHB4F
@slingblade6925 you signed the constitution, you knew what was and was not accepted.
@slingblade6925 his is true. But it doesn't dive into the realm of point shaving

***MESSAGE COMING FROM THE COMMISSIONER AT TOP OF THE HOUR****
@mrod504 all teams are under investigation. Thank you for your concern. It will be noted.
We believe the league to be running smoothly. Since we are on the horizon of the playoffs, it is a good time to ensure everything is well.
As is common practice, we will begin random checks and investigations into every team. This is just a normal function of our front office.
Any violation of League Conduct Policy is punishable by a suspension of no more than one postseason ban.
First &amp; foremost, all games will be fair. Meaning, there will be no insider tips, bribes, point shaving, or falsely setting another's lineup
In light of Mr. Canseco's situation and the NFL's current fragile nature, McClusterfucks would like to remind you of league conduct policy.
@scanseco42: The bidding starts at 5 dollars for McCoy of which the league will take 3 dollars for processing fees.
Another low week for the Village Fuck-Up. Better luck next season! http://t.co/1TTrDZKwCn
@PFTCommenter would you get injured tho? Theirs a difference
@slingblade6925 Comeback city? Or will you continue to get your dick kicked in? http://t.co/OM15v2xtwu
What if I told you, one queer changed Fantasy Football? #30For30
Just tried to follow @scanseco42's lead and get in touch with my feminine side.... It was gay as hell. Didn't like it one bit.
Hey Fuckheads. Someone pick up Prater
@scanseco42 you have to blow someone first
Most previous tweet is directly from PR Department
@scanseco42, I swear to God.. If your sex tape leaks.... I will lose my shit. If I see your naked ass, you better be hitting Selena Gomez

@Ryan_Bourgeois I'll be sleeping. Goodluck getting everyone awake
@Ryan_Bourgeois I am in the Public Relations Union
Ryan wants to fire me because his fantasy team sucks today. Makes sense right?
@Ryan_Bourgeois I'll call my union rep. That's unlawful grounds for firing.
@Ryan_Bourgeois NEVEEERRRRRR
Everyone ask @Ryan_Bourgeois how fantasy football is treating him.
Beautiful day for some football. Happy scoring.
@PFTCommenter tbh it looked horrible. I usually just stick to mad dog on Thursdays
@slingblade6925 makes sense.
@slingblade6925 literally had nothing to do with saints

@Ryan_Bourgeois nope. Eat my ass
@Ryan_Bourgeois Ryan Fitzpatrick, gherhart, Woodhead, jordy, welker, that's a gritty team rift there
@Ryan_Bourgeois it's about drafting an all white fantasy team. People don't try to win the right way
@Ryan_Bourgeois he has no eyes then
\"We don't see color; we see grit and lunch pales\"

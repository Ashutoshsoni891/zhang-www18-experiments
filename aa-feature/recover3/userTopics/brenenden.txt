@juhmykuh I love it.
My social media accounts come to the limit of unbearable because of all the damn sports postings.
Those trophies don't go home with you and those players will probably never know your name.
I honestly detest hoe much attention we give to sports teams.
@mattagrat ok Mat

Damn, a simple \"no\" is all I needed.
@Marjt143 don't stop the fight. The public education system wasn't meant for children

Drunken pancakes, makin' drunken pancakes. And I got good reviews.
@chels_dianne you about the 408 life now?
Saying social work is the same as studying sociology is like saying physics is the same as mathematics. But wait, its not.
@Marjt143 okay yeah, stop the rhyming.
@rkelly Okay maybe not, I can live with submitting it late.
@marjt143 Dont underestimate the UC student population.
@marjt143 Youll still make them, but Im sure if youd want to visit the island of misfit toys

Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down.
I had a dream that I was back in high school, going to a CECA meet on a plane and shit went down.
I remember when staying up until 4 AM was the coolest thing, now I just wish I was asleep by 12
@chels_dianne I just watched it too

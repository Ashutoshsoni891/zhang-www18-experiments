@DJTommyTrouble @Jfarrers Tory party conference keynote speeches.
@VisceralCuties I have this to look forward to this afternoon. Are shoes obligatory?
@YourMrBumbles Oh crikey...
@Lamnguin I'm just glad C learned about the attack after we'd been there. Positive reinforcement already in place. Job done :)
@Lamnguin Yes. It was very quiet &amp; there was a reserve which made me sad. Important to go though. It'll get better.
@nogbad I HOPE so. I think the problem is I've got to do learnin about stuff I don't really want to learn about now :/
@Lamnguin I'm splendid! Had a fab weekend with Charlie. He's coming on in leaps &amp; bounds :)
@Lamnguin But how IS your back? *proper genuine caring face*
I think after all that bath excitement I should do some nice gentle knitting. My studying mojo seems to have disappeared :/
@Lamnguin *proud*
@Lamnguin How's your back, deary?
@EscapedHere I can't have the bath as hot as I used to. Because HORMONES. Keeps the pages safe for longer :)
@EscapedHere YES!!!
@Lamnguin I can get out all by my own!
@JimiIndieShed @SBT_Design Ha ha ha ha ha!
I've stayed in the bath until it's gone cold &amp; my toes are wrinkled. I haven't done that for YEARS 
@JimiIndieShed @SBT_Design Do it!
@JimiIndieShed Nope.
@JaneeDevine You're welcome. Just make sure you sit down &amp; explain it to them beforehand. And do it every mealtime. Then reward if finished.
@JaneeDevine Yes. I got tutted at by other mums, but... They eat everything. With excellent manners. And no messing about.
@JaneeDevine I used to set a 30 minute timer when they played that game. 10 min warning at 20 mins, then plates away at 30.
@uberbobs @Djluckyheather Ha ha ha ha ha ha (excuse me while I adjust my corset) ha ha ha ha HA!\n\nHa ha.\n\nNo. 
@booksandfood1 @andyparmo No - but it's a positive choice. I'm going to enjoy the peace &amp; quiet (and thank you x).
@booksandfood1 @andyparmo My boys are away for Christmas!!
@uberbobs @Djluckyheather See they could be doing ALL of that. While you sit and have a beer! 
@Djluckyheather @uberbobs Bobsy - rescue that woman! Play vacuum cleaning with the varmints!
@booksandfood1 @andyparmo That's what I do normally. They're coming down this year as soon as the boys are away :)
@EscapedHere Send the one who didn't turn up when s/he was supposed to away x
@uberbobs @Djluckyheather And WE get to put our feet up. Eventually. Maybe ;)
@uberbobs @Djluckyheather it anyway and they've gained a valuable lesson in work ethic &amp; boosted self-esteem :)
@uberbobs @Djluckyheather ask yourself what's the worst that can happen? You have to do it again when they are in bed. You'd have had to do
@uberbobs @Djluckyheather https://t.co/qPYwiNZW8t
@uberbobs @Djluckyheather Temporary chaos. Short term pain for long term gain. We are talking BIG picture Bobsy.
@uberbobs @Djluckyheather Go teach those varmints how to do the dishwasher... we are on a MISSION Bobsy!
15 minutes to iron one polo shirt.  WORTH EVERY SINGLE ONE :)
@uberbobs @Djluckyheather Oh BOBSY *sigh* 
@ebookwoman It seems a lifetime away already!
@tobhk Won't be my boys :)
#makingmen https://t.co/tfuH8TbHPq
@nogbad I'm trying not to give that too much thought.
@nogbad It's a good job she's one of my favourites ;) We did LARF.
@nogbad Oh this is true... my lovely Friday lady said last week \"you're looking SO much better! AND your love handles are shrinking...\"
@Djluckyheather @uberbobs It is! Teddy stares STRAIGHT ahead in the mirror if he has to brush his teeth while I'm in the shower. Poppet.
@nogbad I'd be doing the same thing but with ginger beer OBVS!
@Djluckyheather @uberbobs There's only the preteen embarrassment of seeing your mum's boobs can achieve that :/ \n\nAnd even then...
@Djluckyheather @uberbobs My work here is DONE! XXX
@Djluckyheather @uberbobs Is TRUTH. Xx
@Djluckyheather @uberbobs Get them on the vacuum cleaner NOW is my advice. They genuinely LIKE doing the stairs &amp; the edges. Funny bunnies.
@Djluckyheather @uberbobs And they'll load &amp; empty the dishwasher &amp; put the washing machine on &amp; VACUUM. Varmints are ACE at vacuuming xx
@Djluckyheather @uberbobs Yes! Yes you will. You have my solemn promise. And they'll make you tea &amp; bring it to you IN BED. xx
@Djluckyheather @uberbobs Mine are a couple of years older though. SOON you'll be free too!
@Djluckyheather @uberbobs I'm about to teach mine how to iron their own clothes. And then I'll be FREE!!!
@Djluckyheather You can send them to me. I wouldn't take them off @uberbobs though ;) \n\nHope you feel better soon x
@lomelindi12 Also wall. And heaven knows how but the cream carpet on the landing. Brand new v swish Surrey house made entirely of CREAM.
@lomelindi12 Nope. Stained. Spots of shame staring at me every time I stayed.
@lomelindi12 I did that once at my SIL's house. Marble tiled floor :/ Never dared try it since.
@aGirlcalledBoys That's beautiful.
My people :) https://t.co/idwH35InAZ
@thatpebbles And very *cleansing*. I do like that :)
@thatpebbles That's 16 HUGE portions. I made 20 with those qtys &amp; after 1 I'm not sure how I'll manage tea tonight...
@thatpebbles We use it a lot. I'll send you a recipe for some gorgeous little truffley type balls later. I keep them in the freezer x
@thatpebbles Many many many dates! 700g!!!
@thatpebbles Yes - you definitely need the coconut oil. You could use butter in the main mixture instead though...
@lardychap It's fabulous isn't it? We've got an evening of it planned today. After the ironing lessons.
@thatpebbles Caramel without the caramel... and actually even nicer!
@lomelindi12 So many wrongs in this...
@VisceralCuties 
@VisceralCuties Those acronyms don't count ;)
@VisceralCuties oh it was YEARS ago. Before acronyms were invented! I used to monitor the input into sewage works... sniffing for BOD/COD.
@VisceralCuties don't you go acronyming me, young man!
A vague nod to healthy... courtesy of The Happy Pear https://t.co/WSLohZQP6l
@VisceralCuties I used to work in a lab. Mucky water...
@VisceralCuties Oh! I genuinely thought you were talking about the prettiness of the slides! It's been a long morning...
Go careful out there @TheFlossieTP! Xx https://t.co/eBb5qno6x8
@starlitwolf I think I'd rather not have seen! At least the slug was on the cupboard door &amp; not the floor. Child limping MAGNIFICENTLY ;)
One child falling out of high level cabin bed (with raised sides), one slug removed scaling kitchen cupboard &amp; a FLEA spotted. Good morning.
@YourMrBumbles @veniadata @Christie_lover Ha! I'm not sure I could ever live up to that moniker. I do smell lovely though. I hope!
@chickenprincess @Mrs_Bentos OH. I thought you meant a joke telling off from home!
@billywhizz0 @thatpebbles Mine was about 20 years ago. I can still feel the goo!
@Simon_Pegg @chickenprincess I've just done a Twitter search on 'airloom'. I've got the sadness in my eyes now...
@thatpebbles It was GRIM. I had to use Jif &amp; a scrubbing brush to get it off :/
@thatpebbles Anyone who came within 1/2 a mile of my house in those days will have ended up with a hangover ;)
@thatpebbles If it's any consolation I once stepped on a slug with bare feet. With a hangover.
@Jfarrers Sadness in those eyes...
@thatpebbles Trying. Not. To...\n\nOh fuck it 
@RubbishWife @Ashtonscardiff @gogggs He can do that too! I'm just a tyrant of a mother who insists on different greens daily ;)
@RubbishWife @Ashtonscardiff @gogggs Charlie's favourite. He'd have them every day if I let him.
@StiffPigeon Nooo: I only put the sprouts on last week. They'll not be ready for another 6 weeks.
@RubbishWife @Ashtonscardiff @gogggs We had kale crisps this evening too :)
@bopterror I'm going to have to make some later this week now...
@thes2the2 Indeed.
@YourMrBumbles 1995 - 2003! There, I managed it! X
@YourMrBumbles I'm hopeless with dates. I'll have to use my fingers - hang on...
@bopterror And a side dish of sliced bananas?
The little tyke has just managed to get himself a Get Out of Washing Up card. I'm too soft.
@falconermusic TOTES!
@YourMrBumbles If I still lived in Wroughton I'd show you :)
@ebookwoman You can still buy it I think. Never gets old :)
Charlie chose what we had for tea. He's just leant back, patted his stomach &amp; said \"thanks mum, that was PROPER lovely'. 
Going back in... I've got the boy cleaning the skirting boards. Bwa ha ha.
@YourMrBumbles Some people call it witchery ;)
@YourMrBumbles There's a knack. Easy when you've got it. Corners nested in corners.
@ekctafc @nedthetoothpik Ha ha ha! That means they're on the mend. Marvellous news :)
The good news is we've found Pass The Pigs.
@ekctafc @nedthetoothpik Oh you flatterer. A fragrant one too :) How are you?  And the patient? X
@YourMrBumbles I don't love ironing them. I do them well, but I don't feel the love. I do love ironing sheets though.
@YourMrBumbles @Christie_lover @veniadata I DID!
@nogbad I'm not as green as I'm cabbage looking!
People who RT compliments (however ridilculous) #names  https://t.co/6gcLQYwaI1
The bed is moved. #ThisGirlCan \n\nTackling it has revealed another 3 hours work &amp; new furniture needed for growing boys #ThisGirlWeeps
@davidtims @greythorne Once a copper's daughter... ;)
@kernowbeeching LOVE it!!!
And ironing lessons start TONIGHT. They can crumple their clothes up to their hearts' content then.
When you do your children's ironing but they put their own laundry away \nTHEN you take a peek in their drawers \n\nThere will be WORDS.
@Mulrain @BBCTheArchers BEST name
@davidtims @greythorne I'm not sure that's the sort of thing you should be putting on the public TL 
@defsmith Oh you mean shifting!! Silly me. Only Charlie here... we'll fettle it between us :)
@defsmith Oh they decide what goes/stays. Their stuff is their stuff. Whether it's keeping it or chucking it.
@defsmith Yep. Anything reusable will go off to the Ukrainian orphanage I'm helping with. More worried shifting huge cabin bed thing :/
@DicksterW Definitely you :)
@lardychap @TheFlossieTP 4 weeks, 4 days - still LOVING IT!
@TheFlossieTP Just a bit! If only I didn't like learnin'. And making stuff. And being busy... ;)
@DicksterW Every single one of us. Nice avi, BTW!
@greythorne I'm going to sort mine out too today.  Definitely!
@TheFlossieTP SIGH. I moved here with one desk, a sofa &amp; two suitcases...
@greythorne Ah. They don't....\n\n*checks own bedroom &amp; blushes*
@TheFlossieTP I got rid of SO much 6 months ago. It's crept back in :/
Wish me luck: rearranging the boys' bedroom today.\n\n*need to find floor space first\n**skips welcome
@uberbobs @TheFlossieTP @Djluckyheather Oh Bobsy. You are TOO nice for your own good sometimes.
@TheFlossieTP @defsmith Morning YOU gorgeous! Xx
@TheFlossieTP @Djluckyheather @uberbobs Lay a place for me. The absent guest  xx
@defsmith Morning gorgeous x
Jeez. Can't even use live rolling news commentary excuse... https://t.co/00vGNuuN7k
@YourMrBumbles @Christie_lover @veniadata Oh thank you for that!
Just come across a Russian phrase in Cyrillic and not only read it 'out loud in my head' but understood it too. *proud*\n\n*2 words &amp; swear ;)
Nothing like a puppy on a train to bring a carriage full of strangers together :)
Perfect end to a perfect day. https://t.co/VVWaOaGKqM
Heavy police presence at Edinburgh Waverley. Obv right thing to do, but feels very odd like I'm in Edinburgh and not my Embra.
Checking out the aerodynamics \"pretty good actually, Mum\" @ National https://t.co/OJOtIiMmh7
@thatpebbles oh no.... an anti racist campaigner saw me approaching and FLINCHED. She'd just been subjected to tirade of abuse :/

Charlie has scored with the YoSushi cooks. Free 'odd' mochi balls and a wink.
@malongoman That's for tea.
Happy sushi boy https://t.co/AGrvXan5sc
@ColinTheHuman I'm coming with you!
Afeared now... https://t.co/bX4N3QG5vw
@ColinTheHuman It's a good job you are a bloody good chum ;)\n\nOh my LIFE!!!
He's as happy as I am! https://t.co/tfqXdGZsE0
@StiffPigeon @aGirlcalledBoys @JonathanHumble I'm still working on it. Also answering CAR questions. He still thinks I know EVERYTHING.
@JonathanHumble @aGirlcalledBoys @StiffPigeon HA! I went to school in Easingwold... WITH Fred! Truly!
Pure boy. https://t.co/SB6QmEG5dE
@aGirlcalledBoys @JonathanHumble @StiffPigeon There once was a young lady called Doris. Who had a pet ferret called Maurice.
@JonathanHumble @aGirlcalledBoys @StiffPigeon I'm beside myself with anticipation.
@aGirlcalledBoys @StiffPigeon Show me a ferret with a rabbit fur coat on a lead, and I'll be impressed.
On the train! #scottishborders https://t.co/Hw6rzsU9FY
@aGirlcalledBoys @StiffPigeon oh LORDY. *braces self*

On the bus @ Scottish Borders https://t.co/YrcBMAgiVK
@AlanPedigrew @aGirlcalledBoys @MarchWrites Volleyvonts?
We're on the bus! Charlie is having his wee bus sulk. It's his thing. I'm not going to deprive him. He obviously enjoys it.
My cousin flies out to Lesvos today. To help. The world is FULL of helpers. They don't make the headlines. They're still bigger.
Taking the boy to Edinburgh to the Mosque Kitchen today. It's not about the curry. (Which happens to be rather marvellous.)
@Loudbasket See you in a month x
@DHThomas25 Thank God for that. I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say that could be remotely helpful. I'm thinking of you &amp; yours xx
@DHThomas25 Sweetheart: please let me know you are safe x
I've got Jurassic World, my littlest boy &amp; our knitting. Have a great evening you lot x
@nogbad I can pretty well guarantee he'll be reminding me himself - I'd put a whole Scottish pound on it being by this time tomorrow ;)
@uberbobs You're a BAD dad, but I like you
@uberbobs I'll still bring her cake in prison because I luuurve her.
@uberbobs BOBSY!! That's awful. Can't believe you'd stoop so low to tug at my maternal heart &amp; plead for that girl to come to me.\n\nIt worked
@nogbad He's a fab poppet! He's done 3 loads of laundry today too. I'm going to keep him forever*.\n\n*Probably not
Friday night pizza https://t.co/VHukAUj2du
@uberbobs She's got plenty of time for #wholesome, Bobsy. Don't wish that on her too soon...
@uberbobs Oh I LIKE it!! That's bloody good parenting Bobsy. #thrifty and #Lifeskills
@uberbobs You're not begging NEARLY hard enough Bobsy. Have you bought that poor girl a decent camera yet ;)
@uberbobs That was supposed to be thank you for the OFFER. But you know, I LIKE the offering! Let's keep it!
@uberbobs No. But thank you for offering, Bobsy. I'd have them on short term loan though...
@uberbobs I like your children. A lot more than I usually like OPC.
@Loudbasket And the well-meaning armchair/lifestyle psychologists. They can do a lot of damage x
@Loudbasket I think it's come a long way. I'm still very wary b/c of similar, but I know people who've been really helped by good ones.
@Loudbasket That's how it SHOULD go, I think.  When it's done right x
@Loudbasket I saw the original tweet when it was too late to respond, &amp; thought 'today will be THE day'. It is known x
@Loudbasket That has made me smile lots. X
@landladycheryl I'll feel 100 tomorrow morning when I remember I didn't stretch properly after today's run :/
@landladycheryl I haven't got beyond casting the stitches on!!! And I've pulled the needle wire through. I used to do circular on 4 needles.
@landladycheryl I'll go for a bubbly midfke-aged thing ;) x
@kophoogte It's certainly my idea of a nice evening :)
@kophoogte It's certainly my idea of a nice evening :)
@landladycheryl Keep at it. It DOES come back. And if in any doubt, ask Twitter or YouTube. I'm learning circular knitting now x
@landladycheryl That was 30 years ago!!! Oh LORD now I feel old...
@landladycheryl @jeremycorbyn @Telegraph A given for very few people though, it seems :/
@landladycheryl They're apprentice knitting fairies ;) - I haven't knitted properly since the b/f I was knitting the jumper for dumped me...
@landladycheryl @jeremycorbyn @Telegraph Yes - but even without the martyrdom, summary execution by the state is WRONG. So bloody wrong.
@fizzandnonsense Next week we'll aim for a 4:3 ratio &amp; before we know it he'll be knitting me a giant blankie &amp; my work will be done.
@fizzandnonsense And in the dark of the night the knitting fairies will sneak another 5 rows onto his work &amp; soon he'll have his scarf.
@fizzandnonsense This will involve me picking up 5 of his stitches for every 2 I manage. And then I'll lose count of those 2.
I've got pizza dough proving, the boy is hunting out a film to watch and then we are going to sit and do our knitting together.
@InsideTimeUK @KoestlerTrust I'll see if I can get to it on the last weekend :)
@A_Wee_Bookworm Oooh! I KNEW I could feel it coming :)
There is snow in the air. Mark my words...
Cheeky afternoon run #scottishborders @ Kelso, Scottish Borders https://t.co/ClSWDfBkWH
Overheard from cold, drenched kid &amp; chum \n\"shall I get my duvet &amp; we can get warm?\"\n\"Nah - let's just find the cats\"
@ginlington I was the only other person at the one I went to. It was shit. WRVS is another good place to go. Hosting tea parties is nice.
@defsmith That's to you too. Obvs. Fluffybum x
@ginlington I know it's stating the obvious, but it's a HUGE commitment. It stops when they die. Rewarding but heartbreaking. Every week.
@nogbad Sod cardio. I'm thinking about my thighs. #deeplyshallow
@ginlington I used to do it before the Internet, but it's as good a place to start as any :)
@nogbad I'm nearly broked. Headwind. On uphill journey. The bastard thing will turn round in 3 hours.
@ginlington Help the Aged have a befriending scheme. They make sure you're well matched, too.
I could have walked to work faster this morning :/
@defsmith big love from me xx
@nyncompoop Yep!
@nyncompoop My secretary had to fly out to get me... I don't think I fooled anyone 
@nyncompoop I bashed my ribs once. Blind drunk in Poland. Had to be flown home. Made up ridiculous story about a suitcase falling on me...
@nogbad And TRAMS!
@nyncompoop oh PET xxx
@DicksterW @ellaboheme I'll go and think on. I need to go and peel some carrots. I WONDER...?
@DicksterW @ellaboheme 50 miles would take me into a different country.  To be fair, so would 10 miles...
@Lamnguin @ellaboheme How much for a bag of down to earth cheese &amp; onion?
@DicksterW @ellaboheme they MUST be. That will be why they are so expensive too. Rude doesn't come free...
@nogbad What I need are more late buses...
Daft buggers... https://t.co/qlprm7ZyKP
@nogbad There is no more opera on my horizon... I seek it here and I seek it there but I cannot find a Saturday matinee ANYWHERE.
@nogbad I'd shrivel and DIE wivout culture...
@nogbad @BBCRadio4 You are super good to me! Thank you treasure :)
@nogbad I'll send him out into the briar patch. He likes it there best.
@defsmith You are my absolute tip top best ever Fluffybum. But you shouldn't SPOIL me! At least not so publicly...
@nogbad @BBCRadio4 Ooooh.... which programme? I'll grab it on catchup. He COULD be...
@nogbad I sent poor Charlie out in it to walk the mile &amp; a half to play football. Got a text it was cancelled after he left... got home WET.
Storm Abigail pie https://t.co/6iio7I4mud
@MarianneAmy_ OH...
@divvette oh bless!!!
@divvette @Loudbasket I've PROPER given up.
@MarianneAmy_ I bet you can't remember what any of it was... I had to stop buying stuff. Also had to stop working there because TIME :/
@Loudbasket @divvette It's not quite outweighing making my own tea in the morning.  Yet.
@MarianneAmy_ Perk of the job from volunteering in a charity shop. First dibs. I was amazed no one fought me for it...
@divvette @Loudbasket I feel the need to knit him a full body balaclava.
@MarianneAmy_ It's one of my very best favourites!
@divvette @Loudbasket Reason #478765496 I'm happy to stay single
#mtleybre and rough puff pastry. Because it's PIE for tea. https://t.co/2fxJBTrQ4f
@thatpebbles The trick I've found is for it still to be there when they come back.
@thatpebbles I'm very strict. I expect them to do as much as me in the house. And to their credit, they do. More when I'm writing an essay.
@thatpebbles Good lad! Mine have got in service days today. They're stripping their beds, making them &amp; vacuuming upstairs.
@nogbad @mweller I'm surprised at the poll result so far...
@thatpebbles I've just come back to mine. I've got as far as a cup of tea and even that's not making anything much better.
@nogbad Couldn't that money have been better spent on regional centres &amp; tutors?
@malongoman Gosh. That would be a turn up for the books.
@aGirlcalledBoys I love hot Vimto.
@Ca_Metzger I know x
@Ca_Metzger It was meant as a joke. Never mind!
@malongoman No names.
@thatpebbles There are tissues under the bed. Again... I wasn't made for this life ;)
@thes2the2 Super!
@thatpebbles Fab! Honestly never felt better :)
@defsmith Good grief. That's odd...
I don't know how he sleeps at night though.
MrS has FIVE pillows. But the pillowcases don't match the duvet cover. Or coordinate, even. I'm trying not to judge. Ish.
@defsmith oh yes. But indoors. And without a magnificent Regency pavilion as backdrop.
@ColinTheHuman Ah - I couldn't finish BG. I won't bother with that one... I Let You Go was a jolly good 'easy read' if you fancy a rest.
@defsmith That's why I don't bother. Exactly that reason.
@defsmith Oh... is it that good? We have a skating rink in Kelso. And curling too.
@defsmith What's the new sex then?
@defsmith Could you bring me back a shower mitten of the mildly rough and interesting variety, my sugarplum? Please.
@defsmith It's the new sex. \n\nNot a WORD about only, Fluffybum...
@thatpebbles That would require a serious departure from my #wholesome persona ;)
@defsmith Will you be visiting the glorious joy-filled heaven of the hammam in the foreseeable?
@defsmith I have no linguini in my house. I must rectify this before I have the longing again. Who knows when it will strike?!
@defsmith SO FAR today I have done running and cycling and no biscuit general #wholesomeness.
Thank you for the smug kick up the arse yesterday @defsmith. Now I'm feeling all the smug TOO!
@ColinTheHuman The Buried Giant?
@lardychap Sorry!\n\n*Not sorry.
6 hours after the morning run - back again #cycling #scottishborders @ https://t.co/5psLy8UwRT

Yesterday's #cycling. Distracted by parent evening... #scottishborders @ https://t.co/wkU3p0EhRL
Morning run. Clear &amp; mild. #scottishborders @ Kelso, Scottish Borders https://t.co/41vXcMqkgY
@StiffPigeon Yes. That's it. Exactly. And they ARE :)
@TLB73 Oh love... take care. Take really good care of you xx
@TripeUK Have you got your Christmas recipes ready? I don't want to leave it too late &amp; find I'm missing a key ingredient. (Except tripe.)
Top tip: DON'T watch 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Or any Christmas film, actually. Or any TV at all... https://t.co/VxinBhXSuJ
@Leontia2001 Yep.
@simonpjbest Yes she was.
@Leontia2001 I'd have been happier if that was the case. Her concern was that presentation 'is just as important' as content. For EXAMS.
@Lamnguin @Me_on_Tyne Not YET.
@Leontia2001 The teacher?
@Lamnguin @Me_on_Tyne Business Development Manager GSM/UMTS Central &amp; Eastern Europe. Since you ask.
@Lamnguin @Me_on_Tyne Everyone else was in a suit. I was the rebel they were looking for. And I looked HOT, obvs ;)
@Me_on_Tyne @Lamnguin He'll learn. When he grows up ;)
@TheFlossieTP That's what I want to address. It's  shitty enough media portraying men as either thugs or useless. Not school as well x
@TheFlossieTP I've got a meeting next week with her. With Charlie. He told me she called him a thug... I'm livid.
@TheFlossieTP Charlie's teacher :/
@falconermusic I'm very proud of him.
@Lamnguin @Me_on_Tyne La La La I can't hear you.
I'm quite cross. Can you tell?!
The actual CONTENT of my son's work is fine... but presentation is EQUALLY important.  \n\nConformity of presentation, that is...
@Lamnguin @Me_on_Tyne See. I know you too well. Not clicking.
@FunkyPrawn I actually said \"perhaps he's just expressing his individuality?\" WITH A STRAIGHT FACE.
@Lamnguin @Me_on_Tyne I'm not clicking. It will hurt my ears I KNOW.
And his teacher's primary concern was he finishes his y and gs with an unnecessary flourish. \n\nPerish the thought!
The best thing I learned at parent evening was that my son &amp; his chums 'abused the playground chalk in an outrageous fashion'. My BOY :)
@Me_on_Tyne @Lamnguin I get that reference! I'm SUCH a woman of the world now.
@Lamnguin I could have been a roadie for Mud... SIGH
@CallMeSpits I loved that. Thank you.
@Mulrain Those of us with are the least expert of all!
@Lamnguin You don't know until you try. I got my last 'proper job' on the strength of leather trousers.
@TheFlossieTP It's just moved further up the list.
@Lamnguin Well obvs not. I'll tell them you're hard man leather clad Geordie.
@TheFlossieTP Oooh! You're so fancy... it's on my list of think about x
@Lamnguin You are the loveliest of lovelies 
@DJTommyTrouble @Loudbasket Can I do that even though I don't do Easter? Oh yes of course I can. I can appropriate whatever I like.
@DJTommyTrouble @Loudbasket I might use a half full bottle of gin. I've got two sitting on the shelf. Teetotal decadence.
@Lamnguin Not too much otherwise people might TALK. About me - not you lot. I have a #wholesome reputation to protect.
@grumpynorthernc I've LEARNED. Last year I learned that mustard opaque tights make me look like a fat canary.
On a slightly less feisty note I learned today that teal opaque tights make my legs look fat... I am not cut out for the bohemian leg look.
@Mulrain *hides in a corner wimpering*
@Lamnguin Darling, you ARE all epic shaggers of AMAZING prowess. It's why I'm single - I'm so exhausted by you all.
@Loudbasket @DJTommyTrouble I'm trying to find enough to outweigh the very big 'lacking being made a cup of tea in the morning' pile.
@ginlington I know. She's silly. And doesn't know as much about hubris as I do. Yet.
@Lamnguin I might have left a few in the fields walking the dog.
@fizzandnonsense I say only. Two is more than I can handle quite a lot of the time tbh.
@Loudbasket @DJTommyTrouble I shall add that to my 'joy of being single' pile ;)
@fizzandnonsense That's the many teachers of my children.  Not the teachers of my many children.  I've still only got two.
I've not EVER not got on with any of my children's teachers. I feel quite discombobulated.
@ginlington Yep. She can repeat that to management next week.
@Loudbasket @DJTommyTrouble And I could keep it out all year. Maybe add a crocheted flower in the spring? A twig for all seasons.
@Loudbasket @DJTommyTrouble I'm wondering if I can get away with a twig in a vase of fairy lights this year.
I shall make myself a cup of tea because I am an independent woman who can stand her ground. Politely and firmly. And with cajones of STEEL.
@ekctafc No. And I told her so. Politely.  Apparantly she has more experience of children than I do. \"In her profession\".
I still feel sick. I don't want a drink. Because FOUR WEEKS today. Go me.\n\nI do want a nice cup of tea.
@ekctafc Teacher.
I did not hit my son's teacher. I have never hit another human being in my life before. I wanted to hit her. Hard.
My son also responds well to praise. Which is nice to know. Apparantly children who are used to lots of praise at home don't respond so well
@lomelindi12 Youngest's teacher. She did NOT call him a thug. Apparantly.
I've just done calm measured confrontation with an authority figure. And now I feel sick.
@TheChaosBros Well that went well... she wants to involve management. She's also a very bad liar.
@StiffPigeon @VisceralCuties You two are very rude and horrid and not at ALL #wholesome. I TUT at you.
@Loudbasket @DJTommyTrouble The giveaway will be Rudolph lit up outside the front door.
@TheChaosBros I'm getting changed into conventional but edging just away from dull middle class mum frock RIGHT NOW.
@TheChaosBros I'm going to go for the quiet \"by the way...\" drop it in gently at the end of the interview approach.
I think I may give up and just slay her with the *disappointed* look.
I've got parent evening tonight. I've been practising \"could you explain why you called my son a thug?\" without sounding confrontational.
@charlieIzzyTed It's a cracker!
@Loudbasket @DJTommyTrouble I daren't look next door. It will be soon if not now.
Late #mtleybre - Eddie needed today. https://t.co/cihn1hmmsZ
@nogbad They'll have been grown in the field opposite @TheChaosBros house! What larks we've had there...
@StiffPigeon #culturalconvergence
@StiffPigeon I never go anywhere without a large black pudding. AND a haggis. #gonenative
@StiffPigeon OMG! They are from darn sarf... I'll wear my best knitted knickers.
@scotborders really appreciate it. Thanks do much.
Lovely clients who've offered me a lift back home from theatre have asked if I want to go 'with' them. I'm all smiley :)
@nogbad @scotborders It's a New World up here... a template for the rest of the country ;)
@scotborders I don't fancy chancing that stretch in the dark &amp; I've no alternative route.
@scotborders I'm on my phone &amp; can't fill in the form until this evening. Any chance you could give heads up? I'll do my bit when home.
4 minutes... you stars. Thank you x https://t.co/4vFMYKtDnW
Hi @scotborders - the traffic lights on the road works on Angraflat road out of Kelso don't allow enough time for cyclists. Bit scary.
@defsmith That doesn't feel like exercise though! Talking of which - gotta get on that bike. Work calls. Later!
@Rainbow_Worrier Oh... I guess wibbles happen.  I'm glad she's on her way home :)
@defsmith Lacking exercise. Hello.
Charlie has just remembered that being off school sick is BORING. \n\nHurry up, tomorrow...
Marked as to-read: I Let You Go by Clare Mackintosh https://t.co/q0k7eYxMQJ
@starlitwolf Ha ha! I would, BUT poorly kids, dog &amp; deep ingrained puritan work ethic ;)
@starlitwolf Oh it's not! You're you not her. She WOULD do that. I think I need a lie down 
@starlitwolf YOU UTTER TOERAG! And very clever kitten. If I didn't guess - who would?! Xx
I'm waiting for name news. I'm hoping for Euphemia. Or Gladys. But if she chooses Gladys I'll have to rethink next dog :/
@EscapedHere Ha ha! I might bandage his hands up first. Save doing it later ;)
I'm a very supportive chum too. https://t.co/EsPyYQZ50j
@EscapedHere He's got the day off school! I'll give him a lesson later on. Trouble is, even I'm afraid of my iron.
@EscapedHere He just wanted to make sure he got the day off school ;)
\"Get your lazy arse out of hospital &amp; get home &amp; send me photos, pronto.\"\n\nI'm such a GOOD chum.
Well as I'm not going to be earning any money this morning (can't cancel this afternoon) I might as well enjoy myself. *makes more tea*
Marvellous!  https://t.co/eD47Fh7F2H
@VisceralCuties Ah!!! I thought they weren't supposed to talk to us at ALL at 14... ;)
@grumpynorthernc Euch.
@VisceralCuties Tell me about it! Littlest's refrain is \"And muuurm...\" usually responded to with\n\"Sweetheart I've got to GO\"
I've made good little people. Just the right enough to keep them for another week amount of good. Any more good than that would be worrying.
And now \"I've had an idea to help you Mum. If you teach us to iron we can do all our own things &amp; you'll have more time to do your homework\"
@VisceralCuties \"Why is that your favourite?\"
Oh the little tike has pulled the 'I'm definitely about to throw up' card...
@YourMrBumbles Oh that's SUCH a kind thing to say! Thank you. She and her mother are VERY much loved x
My youngest is a bigger twit than his mother and that's going some...
My youngest is a bigger twit than his mother and that's going some...
Meanwhile the youngest is desperately trying for a day off sick with his Bro. Listing symptoms while displaying all his fibbing tells...
I woke to news of a new person in my life. A teeny tiny newly hatched one. I hope the world will be kind to her.
@Ca_Metzger Oh... x
@Rainbow_Worrier I'll be thinking of you both x
@kernowbeeching I practically lived in those trousers... with the right cut they'd work. Gathered back, flat front.
@kernowbeeching That was unhelpful! Sorry. I wouldn't choose it. But then I had a pair of slovenly moleskin pull ons from Boden: same weight
@kernowbeeching Too thick, I'd say. Oh I don't know. Maybe...
@MsCatMinder13 Gorgeous!
@kernowbeeching Ha! I always worry about spelling. It's wonderful to sew AND wear. Cosy.
@kernowbeeching This is where I realise I've spelled it wrong 
@Lamnguin @defsmith With her VERY CLOSE family...
@kernowbeeching I've got a length of tweed and another of ponte di Roma. They should be safe!
@defsmith @Lamnguin That's only got 4 pages.\n1. Sphinx\n2. Pyramid \n3. Tutankhamun &amp; Howard Carter\n4. IT'S FOREIGN STAY AWAY!
@MirandaWhiting It was a mucky green. I bought it online - bit of a wing &amp; a prayer job.
@defsmith @Lamnguin There's a delta. That'll do.
@kernowbeeching I'm going to go back to knitting. And then make something which isn't quite so slippery &amp; sweary.
@MirandaWhiting Sleeping in silk is heavenly. Just not green ;)
@Lamnguin @defsmith Colin would...
How on earth did I manage to cock up 6 pieces of fabric? Not just once: I unpicked 2 seams last week. I've made HUNDREDS* of PJs.\n*1 &gt;5
@TheFlossieTP Flannel is where the hot chicks hang, treasure.
@defsmith I should be carried aloft by them.
@cherina82 See next tweet ;)
*of course it's not bloody fine at all. \n\nI was never meant to waft around in Chartreuse green silk is all. That's what it is.
I have completely cocked up the PJs. I fear a life of wafting around in soft, gently draped silk is not in my stars. \n\nWhich is *FINE*.
@JaneSoup @lomelindi12 Fab. I'll add it to my list. Full day tomorrow - will need audio help.
@JaneSoup @lomelindi12 Is this a radio thing I should be listening to?
@matsyendrasana @Lamnguin They did :)
@landladycheryl A row of llamas knitting each other's wool... would be something pretty mind-blowing.
@fizzandnonsense That's llamas &amp; magic loop technique.  Not llamas' magic loop technique. I don't think they have opposable thumbs. Yet.
In the wool shop we talked knickers, hot sex (lack of, for you pedants), llamas magic loop technique &amp; pompoms. Don't get THAT with Amazon.
@Rainbow_Worrier Oh crikey. What a day, eh? Hugs right back x
There'll be sewing tonight #copingstrategies
@TheChaosBros Yes I will. We're both good at that. I've just paid out for another 3 months of medication, so ;) x
@lomelindi12 I know. The first time I did it was the first time I felt like a proper grown-up. This is 1st dog though. Feels so much harder.
'End of life' strategy chat with the vet. He's so good. The right mix of pragmatic and empathic. Verdict: \"Not yet\". Thank goodness.
@RoastHse @foska_com RAD as I'm sure the young ones say! He's stropped out in my running jacket. I'll look online tonight :)
\"Why can't I just wear the glow in the dark t-shirt?!\". \n\nYou can. But you can't go OUT.
High-vis discussion with the littlest. He is trying EVERY argument he can think of while skirting round the great elephant 'uncool'.
@Lamnguin That was actually said. On the telly. I was shocked. My children weren't.  I must be better at sex education than I thought.
@MaudieStokes43 We like it roasted. Burned to oblivion ;)
@Lamnguin That's the one. I'm not sure whether to be concerned or not that no questions were asked about the selling of robust semen...
@eddsnotdead That 'can' is a highly ambitious in theory btw ;)
@Lamnguin Talking of which - Teddy is watching a progamme about the apocalypse. Pretend... obvsish.
@MaudieStokes43 We generally love the kale. But that was a MISTAKE. Still, it meant I tired of the pasta pretty quickly.
@DJTommyTrouble @Loudbasket Dear God... SEND IT TO ME!
Broke him! Mum 1: 'Poorly' boy 0. 
@thes2the2 Not in this house.
@Lamnguin It's SUPPOSED to be a play on words and should have been #mtleyBre. I am pure idiot today. https://t.co/7oG4nldKJ3
@eddsnotdead I can do a moon which looks like a squashed doughnut?!
When the boys were wee I used the chocolate button diagnostic. We've upgraded to custard creams now. Teens will be bacon roll I reckon.
Charlie is home from school. He has a biscuit. Teddy is very close to abandoning the limp rag on the sofa act. I'm giving him another 10m.
@Lamnguin It should be a cup of tea. The knitting is for context and added interest 
@Lamnguin Have I done it wrong again?!
@eddsnotdead Ed. You are talking to that woman you see in your TL once in a while &amp; think 'why?!!!'. The one who has never seen Star Wars 
Sorry I'm late! I've been concentrating on learning about circular knitting...  #mtleycre https://t.co/KqX4cUXNSl
@EscapedHere Hmmm. In my experience kitties seem singularly unable to see indoor mice. They just bring perfectly happy outdoor ones in :/
@EscapedHere Yes!
We have a bobble! https://t.co/NyOdphBpqa
Inseparable  @ Scottish Borders https://t.co/LW9GNlTXIz
*gone* Super-efficiency required today b/c poorly child. I'd only be tweeting about missing my hat anyway... it's OK: I'm in Aga house.
@savouryvinegar Oh! Thank you. My nose has never been complimented before. It's proper chuffed ;) x
@nogbad I'm about to find out!
@AlanPedigrew Oh!! Poor Paddy... and lucky you.
The next hat: Snflinga Hat https://t.co/4KgQBTIht3
@AlanPedigrew Clarrie came from a man with interesting tattoos. He asked if I wanted to see secret photos. She liked hares. And barbed wire.
@VisceralCuties GO GO GO!
@YourMrBumbles There's nowt wrong with a good tea cosy ;)\n\nMy hat is NOT a tea cosy *stares HARD*
@Ifwehadanyham I am so proud of this hat! It was very late... I'm wearing it now! Will have to take it of to shower though...
@AlanPedigrew How very regal! He's a real beauty. I'll hunt out a picture of Clarrie later.
@AlanPedigrew How tall will he get? I used to have a beautiful sleek &amp; dark as night black lurcher. Clarrie was her name.
@northumbriana @TripeUK Did the Queen have many tripe shops in her portfolio?
@AlanPedigrew Oh a BABY boy!
@AlanPedigrew How old is Dennis? Don't worry - Betty's arthritis is negating any romantic overtures. She's just interested to know.
@malongoman It's one of your own tweets that you are very proud of, which stays pinned at the top of your timeline.
@AlanPedigrew I do love the Dennis. He's proper.
@malongoman I am SO accomplished ;)
@TulipFairy DO IT! The pattern I used was ever so easy. And free. And only used equivalent of one ball of wool. I'm a rebeginner x
@AlanPedigrew Oh heavens. Betty and Aziz are both on the tripe now :/
@AlanPedigrew Also Betty doesn't fart because she's a LADY.
@AlanPedigrew I am considerably richer than yow ;)\nhttps://t.co/8xR4bc6pVF
I have tea, dog, book, 5 minutes of quiet and MY HAT.\n\nRiches beyond measure.
@TulipFairy Who wouldn't?! ;)
@YourMrBumbles Perhaps cosy is the new wholesome? Good morning x
@MonaHelluvaLott I'll sort it in the morning. Sleep now. Night night!
@nogbad I'm going to see what the sheeps have delivered. How was the day, darling? I know you'll have done him proud x
Going to sleep now. I shall take my hat off. And lay it gently beside me. The HAT can sleep in the middle of the bed!
@cherina82 I think he lives in Birmingham and is telling you fibs...
@MonaHelluvaLott You can attach a homemade chain to shop bought mittens. Break the rules!
@wombat37 You go and have the very best holiday ever (except for #Filey2015 obvs) and hardly think about me at ALL.\n\nAnd come back or else!
@MonaHelluvaLott Mittens always need a good chain ;)
@MonaHelluvaLott I'm learning how to do that!
Just brushing my teeth. In my pjs. And my HAT!\n\n(This won't get old until I've finished the next thing...)
@MonaHelluvaLott I don't know! It's the fun of choosing a new pattern &amp; wool &amp; chatting to the ladies in the shop I'm going for :)
@MonaHelluvaLott me too - but not the right wool!
Guess who's going to the wool shop tomorrow?
@DawnSunrise1 You're welcome! Thanks for the sun dog :)
I'll look at the #ScotlandBill tomorrow. I'm not ruining tonight.
@ekctafc @cherina82 yes it DOES. I agree! I love my hat! It is the hat of wholesomeness.
@cherina82 Yes. It jolly well is! I love it.
Not only have I knitted my VERY OWN HAT - it FITS! Hats don't fit me: I have a wee head (only a wee brain, see). \n\nThe fit is pure fluke ;)
@landladycheryl @cobain_10 Thanks! Perfect all year round! Wherever I go.
@thatpebbles Don't worry about it. It's forgotten x
I knitted my very own HAT! It will get its pompom tomorrow. Too tired https://t.co/I9nCugMhOi
Cosy  https://t.co/EDTEmRpMW2
I'm off. Stuff to do.
@thatpebbles Soup.
@thatpebbles I have to make my own choices according to my means.
@thatpebbles OK...
@thatpebbles UK law?!
@thatpebbles I needed it in one pot to fit in the fridge until I could use it tomorrow :)
@thatpebbles @thes2the2 Can't fault @LidlUK's quality. We eat far better shopping there than we could anywhere else.
@kophoogte I'm going through a similar thing at the moment. It's good to cast these constraints aside x
@greythorne You treasure, thank you. Still haven't made cheese straws with your recipe BTW!  Will do as treat for me at Christmas.
I'm going to keep this for even if I don't have a cold &amp; just don't feel like being magnificent once in a while.  https://t.co/xaXAet3Ttp
@greythorne Yes please! I'd love to try.
@greythorne Oh I don't know. I use Huge Fearnley EatitAll's recipe. Half oatmeal/porridge, a glug of olive oil &amp; some hot water. Wee discs.
@davidgilray Erm  reason!
@greythorne Mine are only Scottish because I made them in Scotland.
I'm in the kitchen &amp; I can't listen to #thearchers because I haven't listened to the omnibus yet. I'm all discombobulated :/
That pesto sounded nicer than it was. It's not often I say this but next time I'd miss out the kale... my culinary gift to you.
@whiley_fox Me too. He's my best favourite.
@thatpebbles Can't do that. Didn't think I was OCD but just the thought makes me shivery...!
@aGirlcalledBoys @JonathanHumble Me too!!
I found pasta!!!! Not the right type but better than pesto on oatcakes...
@greythorne Zackly!
@greythorne I don't allow them ;) I'm sure he gets them elsewhere, but not here!
@thes2the2 @thatpebbles the joy of @LidlUK
@greythorne He would be so delighted. All his Christmases come at once...
@YourMrBumbles No - it's a rare just me &amp; Charlie weekend together. It seems he's very excited about it. I'm VERY happy he is x
The boys are FINE. They're tucking into kangaroo steak, potatoes &amp; broccoli. Just me scrabbling about for food *sniff*.
Tea Plan C...
Plan B was a rather marvellous ad hoc pesto idea from peas &amp; kale &amp; mint &amp; feta cheese. I forgot to check the pasta situation :/
What's for tea on Friday, Mum?\n\n*weeps silently*
@robertshaplik1 @Lamnguin Ah yes... also a rite of initiation at certain boarding schools. I've heard. *ahem*
Tea Plan B...
Reduced to jug volume in 12 minutes #winning
@kophoogte @SimonNRicketts It is a bit Leninesque
@TheTiniestVole @Lamnguin oh pet xx
@TheTiniestVole @Lamnguin Away from your raised beds?!
@SimonNRicketts @kophoogte Has he got piles? Have they all been sitting on the radiators in the cabinet office?
That last tweet purely as illustration of the idiocy of my life. It would be OK except I need that pan. Right now...
Slightly too much stock in the pan to fit into jug. Can't throw anything out (until mouldy, obvs). Spending 20 minutes reducing instead...
@greythorne @porridgebrain Another week I reckon it would have grown legs &amp; I'd have another pet on the bed.
@greythorne @porridgebrain Good call. I won't be having butter bean &amp; squash burgers for my tea after all... https://t.co/YKcr0Yavif
@MsAlliance @Ita99 @MsPerson Sorry - I saw the others after I'd posted!
@MsAlliance Godwin's Law
@AlanPedigrew Jeez! That's no accident...
@ScottishOpera Thank you for bringing it to us. It makes SUCH a difference to our lives.
2 minutes previously: \"Oh mum, thanks for moving the shoe rack! That's https://t.co/baLNJeX4MV
@Lamnguin of course Mud are more famous! You silly thing...
@Lamnguin People who know much more about popular culture than me made it up. I thought it was completely made up - no idea it was a THING!
@robertshaplik1 You AND @Lamnguin are at it with the biscuit jokes I can't understand...
@Lamnguin *tumbleweed*. If you can't make a joke about Mud (which I'd GET), don't try making one at all ;)
@Lamnguin You know full well that's gone right over my head...
@DJTommyTrouble That's artistic expression!
@DJTommyTrouble And arty too!
@thes2the2 Yep!
@thes2the2 It's just a joke thing for a cup of tea with chums. It's not meant to mean anything.
2nd attempt as I hashed up the hashtag #mtleybre https://t.co/UWlMVybn4T
@uberbobs *looks around* Nope - I can only see #wholesome
Poor Betty... the kitten is eating her food. And growling at her. https://t.co/O9wQ3erelk
@uberbobs @TheFlossieTP MOI?!
Moving stuff around AGAIN to find a place for shoes so the boys will take them off &amp; put them there. 6 years I've been at this...
@matsyendrasana @AlanPedigrew @aGirlcalledBoys @Carle63 Probably.
@TheFlossieTP @uberbobs Also get well soon from me too! I can't have him taking all the caring sharing kudos... xx
@TheFlossieTP  I think it's more the stress from trying to imagine @uberbobs being #wholesome
@AlanPedigrew @TripeUK OUCH 
@TripeUK I'm thinking next year... long term strategy!
@uberbobs *proud* #wholesome is more contagious than @TheFlossieTP's lurgy!
@TripeUK I'll enter him on the next round...
Dear @TripeUK. I've switched old Betty to tinned tripe b/c no teeth. The kitten is going WILD for it. Can he be an honorary tripe hound pls?
@AlanPedigrew @aGirlcalledBoys @Carle63 I'm from Yorkshire. We're too poor for coats.
@kophoogte Two SECONDS. They just appear - pounce out. Honestly.  NOBODY saw x
@aslargy *dreams of such a problem*
Me too! And I love seeing them map themselves into their preordained place.  (Facial hair less so) https://t.co/fm9wPgjWkH
@aslargy How has it grown? Do you need a haircut or bringing down a peg or two?
@aslargy Thank you. It DOES! It's a bit big: might have to try making my own...
@grumpynorthernc @AlanPedigrew @aGirlcalledBoys @Loudbasket @hughkeogh I *WAS* fine and happy in my singleness til now...
@ColinTheHuman YEP. And it's always the ones who have never actually lived upstairs ;)
@porridgebrain And then I'd want it to be very dark. And cold. Hide deep under the covers.
@porridgebrain I HOPE they do. It would be a shame to have gone to all that effort else ;) Shall we have a nice cup of tea?
@porridgebrain Ohhhhh! I'm even older. And more naive!! What do they do when they actually MEET &amp; see the real deal? (rhetorical)
Short of explaining I've just cleaned her lavatory, I don't know how to reassure her that she's quite safe in her Daily Express bubble.
She's now trying to find a country she's been to that I haven't. I genuinely don't know where this need to assert superiority stems from.
@porridgebrain What on EARTH is a 'thirst trap'?
Ha ha ha! Worth waiting for.\n\nHave you ever been to London, Doris?\n\nYes, MrsM. I lived there.\n\nREALLY? Where? ...OH.
Corporate politics had nothing on the skills I need to survive this job...
Jeez: she's watching a police fly on the wall thing.\n\n'They should just bring back...'\n\nAnd on this day too :/
@StiffPigeon That happy one especially needs burning.
@thesundaypeople #eyeballhour With real sheets &amp; cellular blankets &amp; hospital corners &amp; everything (not my bed) https://t.co/t0oXH1Q8ov
@lomelindi12 That's my favourite. I have it on audiobook too - narrated by Alan Rickman. It's a JOY.
@lomelindi12 That's my favourite. I have it on audiobook too - narrated by Alan Rickman. It's a JOY.
@lomelindi12 I have it in two anthologies! I'm more a fan of his novels, but that's probably b/c I'm generally more comfortable with novels.
While I'm working, I'm listening to How I Lost You... as a woman very easily confused, this could be interesting.
BTW - if you are looking for a well-written, gripping page turner: I Let You Go is ticking all my boxes.
@RubbishWife That's the one! She's surprised I got here (5 min cycle). The weather in the Highlands (2 hour drive north) was SHOCKING y/day.
@porridgebrain I love it! I especially love you can have long sleeves. My life is bunched up round my elbows x
MrsM started reading the Daily Express headlines to me as I walked through the door. Back to earth with a thud...
@TLB73 Come on. Let's DO this!
@VisceralCuties Give him a big thumbs up from us :)
@VisceralCuties Yep. But still fab when you take them out &amp; they fight over the dish of olives :)
@VisceralCuties Nursery rang &amp; said he had bad tummy ache... my response \"well I'm not surprised!\". Famous last words.
@VisceralCuties Super cool! I dismissed 1st symptom of eColi though b/c eldest had pinched a jar the previous day &amp; eaten the lot, inc brine
@TLB73 Bleurgh work
@TheFlossieTP @lardychap @dawbes Oh noooo... I wonder if anyone else from work has been struck?
@VisceralCuties My littlest asked for a jar of olives for Christmas when he was 3. He got two because I'm a softy.
@PookyH @SweatpantsCafe Just this...!
@lardychap @TheFlossieTP @dawbes We should shower at least once a week, whether we need it or not.
Cycling uphill will be jolly* this morning.\n\n*not jolly at all https://t.co/t0aEymwdkl
@TLB73 I'm splendid thank you! Just running down to the kitchen to make tea &amp; grab a sneaky 5 minute read before the day kicks in. How's you
@TLB73 Morning lovely!
@TheFlossieTP @lardychap @dawbes Yes. You'll live...  xx
@TheFlossieTP @lardychap @dawbes Don't even think about getting out of PJs today xx
@TheFlossieTP @lardychap @dawbes How are you, treasure? I'm still FINE. Bottled out of running b/c weather &amp; Monday morning: not poorly xx
@uberbobs @TheFlossieTP @Djluckyheather It really was! I'm feeling all warm &amp; fuzzy &amp; topped up with chum :)
@Djluckyheather @TheFlossieTP @uberbobs Oh thank you! Xx
@millieweb @wombat37 Oh shucks! (I love it too!) No credit to me: taken by @uberbobs #varmint.
@chickenprincess But I ironed your uniform &amp; hung it up &amp; EVERYTHING! x
@wombat37 SIGH ;) Night night lovely x
@aGirlcalledBoys Thank you, Boys!
@lomelindi12 And all mankind that haunted nigh / Had sought their household fires\n\nThank you x
Last one upstairs makes the tea in the morning...
@YourMrBumbles It was taken by a 6 year old! Isn't she amazing? Her first photo with a 'big camera'.
@defsmith @lardychap Ha! I'm off - all the stuff to do. See you later. Hope you feel much better in the morning, @TheFlossieTP NO WORK xxx
@Djluckyheather @TheFlossieTP @uberbobs Album so far... more in later x\nhttps://t.co/Fc0JY1Cqws
@lardychap @TheFlossieTP Yes! Yes I AM!
@defsmith @lardychap @TheFlossieTP I know! But I don't have an awful lot to be wanky about. I'm keeping that one ;)
@lardychap @TheFlossieTP I'll take that as a HUGE compliment. Thank you.
@lardychap @TheFlossieTP Through the viewfinder. I know that sounds really wanky but I just do...
@lardychap @defsmith @TheFlossieTP One day - maybe. Daisy's seen me twiddle.
@lardychap @defsmith @TheFlossieTP Don't forget about the twiddling. I do GOOD twiddling.
@TheFlossieTP @lardychap DDG!! xx
@Djluckyheather @TheFlossieTP @uberbobs I'm ignoring the fact mine are TWO MINUTES LATE #worsemum
@Djluckyheather @TheFlossieTP @uberbobs No probs - I'll pop them there &amp; link to them, then you can tell me if you want any printing x
@Djluckyheather @TheFlossieTP @uberbobs The pleasure was VERY mutual! Also I luuuurve your varmints. They are aces xx
@Djluckyheather @TheFlossieTP @uberbobs I'm editing some others - is it OK to pop them into Flickr? No names, obvs xx
@TheFlossieTP @defsmith YES!!!
@TheFlossieTP @lardychap Oh you LOVE *blows all the kisses (from a safe distance)* xxxx
@nogbad TOTES!!!! I'll be getting all big-headed soon*. \n\n*shan't
@lardychap @TheFlossieTP Had a proper clever lovely model :) (thanks, though!)
@nogbad Gotta keep current, MrN. It was taken by new protogee. Her first photo!
@TheFlossieTP @lardychap By the poppies I think x
@TheFlossieTP @defsmith I might put  that in my bio ;) xx
@TheFlossieTP @lardychap Keeping it CLASSY this time ;) If you don't like it I'll delete it. But I LOVE it. xx https://t.co/VC2u0tVRSW
@TheFlossieTP @defsmith It was VERY splendid and much more splendid than I could have managed x
@TheFlossieTP @lardychap Would you like to see how beautiful you looked even though you were practically DYING?
@TheFlossieTP @dawbes I'll drink 5 gallons of pre-emptive water tonight. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT ME. You take good care of YOU xx
@TheFlossieTP @dawbes I reckon if I was going to come down with it I would have by now... You POOR thing xx
@TheFlossieTP @uberbobs @Djluckyheather She NEEDS a camera. And more tuition, obvs (me, please MEEEEE!) xx
@Me_on_Tyne @TheFlossieTP @uberbobs @Djluckyheather The youngest #varmint looked a million times better in at than me...
@TheFlossieTP @dawbes Oh no not STILL?! I'm absolutely FINE - don't worry about me! xx
Best day @TheFlossieTP @uberbobs @Djluckyheather x https://t.co/uRaV1oaE3f
@YourMrBumbles @druid1111 @DrJackMonroe Thank you x
Off to make packed lunches &amp; iron uniform &amp; all that stuff. Ta ra.
@DicksterW https://t.co/E9ulc8aIpr
@greythorne I thought you might :)
@greythorne Yes. It keeps me sane.
@greythorne Yes exactly. And it's the time... I could do learnin' with that time. Or making. Or something... work even!
@defsmith @Lamnguin He never forgets. Anything.
@AlanPedigrew #wholesome
@landladycheryl me too. Or at least expand my range.
@greythorne We don't have Ocado. Lidl is only a mile away but it's miserable trudging it all back in the dark &amp; wet.

@DicksterW Hold on I'll do it and post the link - it's full of MARVELLOUS stuff. You'll be dead impressed.\n\n*dies laughing*
@defsmith @Lamnguin I have not seen Star Wars or LotR even though Keith lent me the latter. Which I still have I think. Oops.
@DicksterW I might have to add that to my Spotify Happy Tunes play list!
@AlanPedigrew I also like lashings of ginger beer but we don't have fizzy in the house. Because I'm a puritanical monster.
@Lamnguin @defsmith GOSH
@defsmith @Lamnguin John Lewis ad or Star Wars?
I've decided that the thing I like best about not drinking (apart from the obvious stuff) is hot chocolate.
@defsmith @StiffPigeon Are they sure it was dead and not just me having a sneaky lie down?
@Lamnguin I haven't seen it. I may add it to my Star Wars collection.
@defsmith @StiffPigeon I like that one best of all *scratches bum*
There's going to be a lot more bought from the online supermarket this winter... that was nasty. Tbh, I'd have disliked driving just as much
@GigerPunk Gosh that's a blast from my past! Can't possibly be a swearword.
Wellies, big coat &amp; Lidl time... I'm going IN. (reluctantly - it's shitty out there)
@Rainbow_Worrier Is Scunthorpe free from fuckwits?
The Yogi says... https://t.co/BnmshwMIuF
@Rainbow_Worrier Retweet = I wish I'd said that. So tell your friend WELL DONE!
@TheFlossieTP I have STANDARDS. I think they forgot x
@TheFlossieTP My travelling companions today were not my favourite. Next time! X
@lardychap Here you are... https://t.co/7fbEPeRDEs
@TheFlossieTP I've probably picked my nose too much ;)
@kernowbeeching Wonderful!
@CumbrianBlondie I bow reverentially before you.
Apparently fuckwit is a swearword. Who knew?
I've only sworn 16 times on Twitter, so I'm on Santa's nice list. YAY! Find out if you've been naughty or nice at https://t.co/TfRs9GQp67
@Loudbasket I'm going to go and look...
Home. Aziz is telling me off. Colin is sulking. All is well. Apart from massive nose bleed. I've never had one before. Odd.
@TheFlossieTP I hope you feel better very soon xx
@Lamnguin He'll have them lined up for me...
@lardychap Another 45 minutes.
@Lamnguin He's let me on now, and like a stuck record told me he was having a well earned rest break. Every single time...
@lardychap EUCH
@Loudbasket @thecatreviewer I give them extra points for attitude...
@lardychap I don't want to find out what that could be.
@Lamnguin It seems so. Who knew?! He's locked himself in, in the warm, waiting until the last minute to let me in.
@lardychap He needs to work on his flirting technique then. But anyway. Ewww. And what would we TALK about?
@Lamnguin I'm at Berwick now. It's bloody cold. I'm waiting for not-my-favourite driver to open the bus.
@lardychap oh goodness me no don't think so. Also he was at best (worst?) half my age. He had a stoooodent railcard. He was just impudent.
@nogbad This is TRUE!
@Lamnguin Just passed the barn on the right.
@Lamnguin Exactly. You should have known better than to Google when there's Dr Dotty here.
@nogbad It's odd isn't it? The ties that bind us.
@goodbrightdog Oh that's becoming a fast distant memory for me!
I'm not sure what I've done to upset the man opposite me, but he keeps scowling at me... it's quite disconcerting.
@Lamnguin And executive stress.
@lomelindi12 I've got it in a poetry anthology at home - I'll look once I've got a cup of tea in hand x
@lomelindi12 No I haven't. I'm a big fan of Hardy though.
@ColinTheHuman Ha ha ha ha HA! Funny man...
@ColinTheHuman That wasnt meant to sound as miserable as it did!!
@ColinTheHuman I've no one left. My cousin is in a different part of Yorkshire, but it could as well be a different country. It's not home.
@ColinTheHuman I don't know if I could.  I'd be afraid of finding out I didn't fit any more. I've found a kind of comfort in not belonging.
@lomelindi12 No - I think it's just a wistful time of year. Important to focus on the present &amp; its positives.
@thatpebbles Ha yes! Today's frock has a label to help!
@ColinTheHuman it's odd isn't it?
It's a jolly good job I love where I've made my home &amp; the life I've made there. That's a lovely thing to keep in mind.
It's also an odd thing that even though it's more than 30 years since I left Yorkshire, I still feel a melancholic tug when I leave.
I mention that only to say that I think we should always remember anyone who has ever put themselves forward as protectors.
It's 24 years almost to the day my friend was killed. Not on active service but on a routine practice combat flight. His loss is still felt.
@TheFlossieTP @nogbad More wholesome than anyone could have imagined...
@nogbad @TheFlossieTP No - I ended up borrowing that train *whispers* without asking!
I'm ON THE TRAIN! @TheFlossieTP. Only mild meltdown at barrier at 10:40 when I thought I was catching the 10:43 ;). Missing you enormously x
@starlitwolf Yes to ALL of that x
@theweeyin15 I'm on my way home now... it's been so lovely. Gentle and affirming and full of love xx
Morning with Floss &amp; her geese https://t.co/g2kceu5JEe
@theweeyin15 Ha ha! I LOVE it. Hello lovely x
Remembrance #weekendwithFloss @ Yorkshire Sculpture Park https://t.co/kcWpGJnbJY
@malongoman waaaah! NO. Even if just for Sunday morning cup of tea in bed comfort...
I'm still no further in to the middle of the bed. I'll know I've made it when I wake up in the middle.
@holmfirthartist @YourMrBumbles I visited yesterday. In the mud ;) It was beautiful &amp; moving - more for it not being instantly available.
The geese had a 4am party. They've collapsed already in a drunken stupor. Lightweights.
@YourMrBumbles I like evocative. Smells are my usual trigger - I can be stopped dead in my tracks sometimes by a smell. x
@FunkyPrawn I know so x
@FunkyPrawn They are. And everything will be OK. x
@FunkyPrawn Not even when the fat lady sings :)
@FunkyPrawn Oh love x
@thatpebbles Nope! Just being a twit ;)
@Vivienne17 I think that's knickers...
@thatpebbles luckily it's the same front &amp; back - just hung a bit funny!
I've had my frock on back to front all day...
@uberbobs PS it's VILNIUS!!
@uberbobs I was struck dumb with AMAZEMENT and WONDER.
@lardychap @uberbobs @TheFlossieTP says otherwise
@uberbobs @TheFlossieTP We are approaching? Top or bottom?
@thes2the2 That's why we have them.
@lardychap No, thank goodness.
@JustJimWillDo Ha! That would have been a surprise...
When you unpack and find the cat's been using your suitcase as a bed #thatday
@Loudbasket @DJTommyTrouble @aGirlcalledBoys @AlanPedigrew @falconermusic Oh God - social media DEATH!
@uberbobs @TheFlossieTP I think we might all need ear whispering this afternoon. It's looking COLD out there!
@uberbobs @TheFlossieTP We might whisper later 
@AlanPedigrew It's quite the thing! We are going to team gadding with culture too. It's a heady mix.
@TheFlossieTP @uberbobs Shhhhhh! Don't tell everyone!!
@uberbobs @TheFlossieTP I know... a Friday train journey without wine was a shock to the system!
@AlanPedigrew I AM! Gadding here there and EVERYWHERE. I'm looking out at a canal and a dark satanic mill chimney right now. And GEESE.
@uberbobs Oh Bobsy.... @TheFlossieTP and I remember going to bed. We are so #wholesome
An early #motleybrew because I shall be out gadding this afternoon https://t.co/TtE1eNcJLm
Intimacy, train journeys AND not living in each other's pockets...  https://t.co/v53E4SS4qH
@AlanPedigrew Bugger off!
@AlanPedigrew Ha! I'll have a lend then. Mebbe. Night night, chum :)
@AlanPedigrew Mine aren't so comfy any more . Bloody baby feet...
@AlanPedigrew bet not as old as mine.
@AlanPedigrew @Loudbasket @aGirlcalledBoys @DJTommyTrouble @falconermusic PS you might want to work on your sales technique.   - free &lt;5sec
@AlanPedigrew @Loudbasket @aGirlcalledBoys @DJTommyTrouble @falconermusic I've had one already. I gave it back.
@AlanPedigrew @Loudbasket @aGirlcalledBoys @DJTommyTrouble @falconermusic Hmph.
@evermoreanon @TheFlossieTP Yes. Yes she IS.
@Lamnguin Night night!
@TheFlossieTP Well, not MUCH
@Lamnguin And MANY pillows
@AlanPedigrew @Loudbasket @aGirlcalledBoys @DJTommyTrouble @falconermusic Oh no thank you.
@AlanPedigrew @Loudbasket @aGirlcalledBoys @DJTommyTrouble @falconermusic If I drink any more tea I'll BURST.
I'm at my chum's and I've got a big bed &amp; my very own bathroom and a VERY full tummy &amp; I'm all the happy.
@Loudbasket @AlanPedigrew @aGirlcalledBoys @DJTommyTrouble @falconermusic @MarianneAmy_ @hughkeogh @aslargy I'm VERY excited!
@tobhk Nooooooo!
I'm going to stick my head in a book &amp; look clever for a bit ;)
There's a very attractive man diagonally opposite me. Gosh...
@tobhk Ha ha ha!!!! Xx
@defsmith @ekctafc @lardychap @wombat37 You don't deserve one ;)
@tobhk A half of milk stout in the snug...
@defsmith @lardychap @ekctafc @wombat37 I did write an essay last week. I'm all OVER the words!
@tobhk I remember when Corrie was ALL oldies...
@Mulrain I'm from Yorkshire - t'other side, but we are all one big happy family :)
@defsmith @lardychap @ekctafc @wombat37 Tritto. Big hugs from here x
@tobhk I haven't watched it for YEARS. But ewwwww!
@Ally_Nuttall @chickenprincess Gosh...
@smuffie Awwww!
@Lamnguin I have NO idea! They know I luuurve them.
@Lamnguin I have NO idea! They know I luuurve them.
@thatpebbles I've got a craving for wine gums now :/
Lovely train driver saw me running, got out, pushed the button to open the door &amp; welcomed me in with 'hop aboard, love!'\n\nI  Yorkshire.
On the last train! Made it :) #weekendwithFloss
@thatpebbles Jelly beans are evil. Nearly as bad as wine gums.
@cherina82 West Yorkshire!
@wombat37 Indeed. And the site of many other fun times also :)
@wombat37 @TheFlossieTP Not often.
I'm at York now. I love York. #weekendwithFloss
@wombat37 @TheFlossieTP I'm sure I can think of an ex or two who would agree!!
@cherina82 I'm sure we will. Hello lovely! How are you?  Xx
MrsJ &amp; I are going halves on this. We are SUPER excited... https://t.co/YsRV7lxZ0R
Now I'm feeling bad because favourite bus driver will be feeling bad I missed my train &amp; doesn't know I managed to get on the next train OK.
@taffy3rock EXACTLY! It's a little town - they share. And usually share nicely :)
@YourMrBumbles What are you seeing at the theatre?!
@TheFlossieTP I'm getting closer! #weekendwithFloss
@EscapedHere It's my new naughty ;)
@EscapedHere I'm having an evil Diet Coke...
@EscapedHere I'm having an evil Diet Coke...
@fizzandnonsense Luckily they saw the funny side. Then they were naughty &amp; taught me words in Russian instead of Polish. What larks we had.
@fizzandnonsense to walk to work muttering \"Dzien dobry\" over &amp; over. Then immediately blurt it out in Russian when I got to reception.
Trolley approaching. I've got the same thing going on I used to have on the way to my office in Poland. Instead of \"don't say wine\" I used
@Lamnguin YES!
@EscapedHere Plus I'm not going to break &amp; undo all the good work for crap wine ;)
@EscapedHere Yes. It's fine at home - I deflect by making stuff. A bit harder on the train when it was habit. Not impossible though.
@thatpebbles If I could I'd never stop.
@thatpebbles Oh gosh yes. Completely unaffordable otherwise.
@EscapedHere The problem now is when I'm in a situation I used to 'solve' with a glass of wine (or more!). Learning how to deal with those x
@EscapedHere Wanting wasn't really my problem. It was stopping. Once I'd had the 1st drink I never knew whether I'd remember going to bed.
@EscapedHere I'm feeling pretty proud of me.
I don't want a drink now, I just would have out of habit.
A month ago I'd have gone to the pub while I waited &amp; had a large glass of wine &amp; another by now on the train. (I'm fielding ex texts too)
@thatpebbles On it now and made myself invisible when the ticket inspector went through. I MIGHT get away with it.
@YourMrBumbles Fabulous! I'm really glad xx
@tobhk Good x
@thatpebbles Nope. Got to the platform as it was pulling away.
I haven't seen that bus driver in months. He was so genuinely sorry we didn't make it. And asked after the boys. He's a LOVELY man.
Waiting, waiting #weekendwithFloss @ Berwick-upon-Tweed railway station https://t.co/nIySvr48Wa
@tobhk Oh pet. No - I'd much rather one of us at least got there!
@MsCatMinder13 Couldn't  - work &amp; boys.
Please let the 16:07 67 Kelso - Berwick driver know that I'm really grateful he tried so hard @PerrymansBuses. And he's still my favourite.
@nogbad No. But I'll still do it. It's what credit cards were invented for.
@kernowbeeching Yes. Trying to get a later one now.
Bugger
@nogbad To get me to the station on time.
I'm going to switch off now and try not to look at the time.
@Lamnguin @thes2the2 Somebody should make a film about hijacking a bus.
Look @PerrymansBuses (also this one is my favourite driver). https://t.co/xJTJD6dB5c
@thes2the2 I'm on a bus! What on earth do you think I'm going to do?
@thes2the2 I didn't ask. I don't care. If I'd asked he'd explain and not drive.
I'm on the bus. Driver promising to do his best. Pray for me #weekendwithFloss
@lardychap Train. Not sure I'll catch it now :/
@aslargy I'll kneecap him
@lardychap NOT YET
If numan gets on the bus before me he's first to die #waitingforthebus
@thes2the2 NO
@thatpebbles *grabs it and kills EVERYONE*
STABBY #waitingforthe bus
@thatpebbles I'm getting the bus to the train station. To catch a train 5 minutes after the bus was supposed to arrive. Bus now 7mins late.
Feeling a bit ansty now. It's only a very short step from stabby. #waitingforthebus
81a is AWAY! COME ON 67...
A new man has arrived. He has not seen the purse action. I'm glaring at his back instead.
It's the 81a. I don't want 81a. I want 67. Which is due NOW.
The WRONG bus is in the bus stop! Make it GOOOOOO!
I've got my purse out meaningfully. And I've walked past the other bus people and smiled at them. Nodding at my purse.
@lardychap RUDE
There are now two other people at the bus stop. Would it be VERY wrong to ask them to have their money ready? Preferably the right change?
@meatloaf1333 Thank you. You too.
@Lamnguin @TheFlossieTP The latter part is guaranteed 
@meatloaf1333 I don't have a choice
At the bus stop #weekendwithflossie https://t.co/DyxrhX9S5A
How did your daughter enjoy her first week @YourMrBumbles?
@tobhk Fingers crossed!!
@lardychap Now whose housekeeping is lax? Hmm?
@kernowbeeching I've gone to the bus stop in town rather than the one nearer home so it doesn't have to make an extra stop #cleverkitten
@lardychap A gentleman would have offered her his vest.
I'm at the bus stop 10 minutes early WILLING the bus not to be late. I've got 5 minutes between bus &amp; train... only very slightly anxious.
@MsCatMinder13 @TheFlossieTP @defsmith oh poor pet. I hope you get well soon x
@lardychap Her vest was probably in the wash.
WORK! And a lovely bicycle ride. And it's not raining. LUCKY me.
@thatpebbles I'll try not to prod myself in the eye ;)
@thatpebbles Then I'll get that too. Because I'm worth it :)
@thatpebbles I'm determined that my last year before 50 is going to be full of positive things. Set a good foundation for post-50 :)
@thatpebbles LOVE IT!!!
@thatpebbles https://t.co/WH28HWT6mY\nAmerican - hence (sic)
@thatpebbles Seriously, I want to be able to write/draw a journal AND draw ideas for things I want to make.
@thatpebbles Sketching ;) I've bought The Creative License (sic) and I'm going to unleash the drawer within. Then progress to watercolour.
@defsmith Snogging behind the samovar *sigh*
I've just ordered a sketch book. I'm pretty sure that's the last thing off the \"I cant/you're no good at\" list. Better than a bucket list.
@defsmith We were actually really truly thinking of going to a tea dance... I'd obviously have taken you up on your offer for that.
@lardychap GOSH.
@defsmith YES!!!!!
@lardychap Normally, obvs: but I have to change at York station and it gets pretty draughty there.
@lardychap That's what I've packed!
@VisceralCuties *wibble*
@Loudbasket @DanRebellato Every speeding fine, every parking ticket...
@VisceralCuties Cows don't look. They bore into your soul and extract your darkest secrets. And SAVE them.
@TheFlossieTP SEE YOU TODAY!!!! xxx
@defsmith It's so easy - I'm not even having to be proactive about it! 
@TLB73 Morning! x
I'm off to do that no screen thing. And knit. Ta ra x
@JimiIndieShed #names
@JimiIndieShed That goes in handbag. For the JOURNEY. I love journeys.
@dbrereton Not better or worse, just different.
@dbrereton Exactly. It's interesting though how the equipment changes the type of picture I take: big camera pics v diff from phone.
@defsmith NOOOOOOO! I'm not ever doing THAT again. Nu uh. #wholesome
@dbrereton Yes - that's what I love about it: everyone CAN. It's the my gear's better so I must be better twits who irritate me.
Knickers, PJs &amp; toothbrush. Sorted :)
@kernowbeeching Two nights away! Off to see my lovely chum @TheFlossieTP #weekendwithFloss
@dbrereton You're very kind. I do love it. It's a wonderful escape.
@nogbad BUGGER. I'm away. It's a very nice away but I can't go to that. Is it an annual thing? I'll go next year.
So far, packing has consisted of loading up the kindle... I'm a bad woman.
@dbrereton Why thank you, Mr!
@Torquil1956 I cll it the wee bridge because it's smaller than the other two and I don't know its name... which is shameful. I'll find out!
@SamGouldson Next time you're up here, let me know! It is a LOVELY place to live. Great for kids too :)
@SamGouldson Were you?! I live here!

@davidtims HA!
@davidtims Kids' bedtime, packing for weekend away and then MAYBE an hour sitting down finishing the hat. I don't envy you the late commute.
I have written ALL the words. Now I can catch up with all the learnin' I missed while I had the lurgy!
@davidtims Finished!
@davidtims oh don't get me wrong: ours do. They're great: just feel obliged to give out homework. Other parents expect it. Apparently.
@davidtims Yep - but they don't. Tbf the teachers don't like it either. It's all box ticking.
Off to finish this essay. Then it's packing for #weekendwithFloss. 20 minutes tomorrow to get home from work, changed &amp; on the bus! Excited!
Bloody buggery bollocky fireworks in private gardens. At least the dog is deaf now...
@davidtims I'm not a fan of homework anyway. Their time at home with me should be filled with stuff we want to do, not the school.
@davidtims It is when you're trying to cook tea &amp; then go out in the dark to get the Christmas shoebox stuff &amp; then do your OWN homework.
@craftsBoy @hugeshark @porridgebrain @chickenprincess Oh! Sewing a cushion is FINE. You end up with a brilliant best friend.
@hugeshark @porridgebrain @chickenprincess NEVER KNIT YOUR BOYFRIEND A JUMPER.
@porridgebrain @hugeshark @chickenprincess I don't like that it happened OBV... but #sista
I've got parents evening next week. I'm going to go with the broom shoved up my arse.
Both kids have parental-input-required homework! Joy heaped upon joy.
@hugeshark @chickenprincess @porridgebrain Oh I hope not too!
@grumpynorthernc Yep. The bicarb will be there for extra oomph.
@hugeshark @chickenprincess @porridgebrain We've all got one...
@aslargy And warming socks &amp; vests &amp; knickers.
@grumpynorthernc Baking powder :) Or just use self-raising flour if it specifies plain. You could chuck in an extra egg too x
@thatpebbles I'm a sexy beast ;)
@grumpynorthernc *baking
@grumpynorthernc You can use baling powder instead, ish, but probably not. What is it?
@thatpebbles I've had to turn round now to avoid homework. Now steaming my bosom.
Also: homework set specifically which requires parental involvement. Just NO.
@thatpebbles I haven't dared since #filey2015
I'm warming my bottom on the oven again. In my next life I'm definitely going to have an Aga. And hopefully be a cat.
@Lamnguin I was hoping he's been in Asterix. If he hasn't my whole essay falls apart.
@thatpebbles I WOULD. When I've stopped being poor x
@Lamnguin I'm going to write something about the Vatican. Or Naoploean being tight.
50 words left to play with :) #OU
@hugeshark @chickenprincess @porridgebrain WOW. Oh WOW wow wow. You CLEVER kitten!
@chickenprincess @hugeshark @porridgebrain I've only played with them once before - 30 years ago. The tank top for the b/f who dumped me...
@hugeshark @porridgebrain @chickenprincess It was a free one, I'll check the printout &amp; see if I can find the original web page x
@chickenprincess @porridgebrain It was wool I had left over from the cushion which took me THREE years...
@SamGouldson 'parents are not looking out for the best interests of their children'?! REALLY?!
MrS has left his empty bring all the presents back for Doris behind. MrS is sore in need of a good woman. (Not me).
@MIkef45 It's MAGIC!
@MoorseyL @Shuchan Oh thank you! My darling @porridgebrain has sorted it :)
@porridgebrain @chickenprincess I like it. I've got to because it's my first hat and I intend wearing it lots.
@porridgebrain @chickenprincess I do believe you are right. I've started off on a purl haven't I? I am a NINNY. It's now a design feature.
MrS doesn't have any biscuits. He'd be better off eating biscuits than smoking. And I'd be a lot happier ;)
Thanks @MIkef45!
@porridgebrain @chickenprincess Do I need to knit into the back of either the purl or the knit stitch?
Going to have '5 minutes' first. @porridgebrain &amp; @chickenprincess how do I stop this ridge going from rib to ss? https://t.co/DwzuOjP0mu
MrS has left the building. I'm going to bleach EVERYTHING.
@malongoman If I ever see any again I SHALL :)
@malongoman I haven't seen any up here. Not that I could use them now I'm #supersoberwholesome.
MrS is home packing to go on hols. He's banned me from the kitchen while he nicotines up. \"It's a health hazard zone, Doris\"\n\nI like him.
@Lamnguin @ebookwoman Not rising...! I've got a late start this morning :) Time to write some more words.
@Lamnguin @ebookwoman Heaven help us all...
@Lamnguin @ebookwoman Oh you are a rascal. Aren't you back at work yet?
@Loudbasket @goodbrightdog @andyparmo Joy. Thank you.
@Lamnguin @ebookwoman Isn't everyone getting the Odyssey &amp; Iliad mixed up or am I lost &amp; confused of rural Scotland?
@YourMrBumbles Oh YES. And podcast too.
@wombat37 @Lamnguin Don't think about that. Not EVER. There lies madness.
@SamGouldson @Lamnguin I love those rosy fingers!
@wombat37 @Lamnguin Get YOU!
@Lamnguin @wombat37 Scotland not Northumbria.
@YourMrBumbles Flattery will get you everywhere!
PS I can't believe NONE of you apart from @Lamnguin want to come and see The Iliad. It's got swords and thighs and thighs and EVERYTHING...
That's me done for tonight. I'm doing that good sleep hygiene thing... another fad to add to avocado toast probably. Night night chums x
@TheFlossieTP @wombat37 I don't have any silk knickers :( Half a pair of silk PJ bottoms does not equal a pair of silk knickers... ALAS
@TheFlossieTP @wombat37 We might Periscope the stage version...
@wombat37 @TheFlossieTP HA!!!!! Great minds!
@TheFlossieTP @wombat37 Gosh I REALLY hope I don't get bitten in the KNICKERS again...
@booksandfood1 I'm putting your dates in the diary &amp; we can sort out details nearer. I know some LOVELY places x
@wombat37 @TheFlossieTP I'm looking forward to it SO much #gadding
@JustJimWillDo It's helping enormously. And I get to look at it and think 'THAT would never have existed if I'd opened a bottle of Merlot'
@TheFlossieTP We shall give a whole new gloss to gadding! #weekendwithFloss
I've also gained a beautiful cushion, nearly a pair of silk PJ bottoms, half a knitted hat (with cables) and an almost finished essay.
Three weeks by the way. THREE whole weeks. And it's feeling really rather marvellous.
@nogbad They can make a den with it. And use it as a hide to shoot their own from.
Almost done @TheFlossieTP! Referencing &amp; a bit of highlighted 'do more blurb here' then I can go gadding! #weekendwithFloss
@nogbad I like it very much - I prefer it to beef. I shall treat us next week.
@YourMrBumbles I only came to #thearchers in my early 20s. Teddy asked me a question about it this evening - he'll be hooked before long!
Essay!!! I've got my learnin' mojo back. In spades.
@BBCNewsPR @evermoreanon Shame...
Me at 18:59 I'm just putting the radio on for my programme, sweethearts.\n\nMe at 19:02 Shhhh. SUSH! BE QUIET!! Upstairs NOW!!!\n\n#thearchers
No YOU are washing up this morning's breakfast dishes to make way for the tea dishes...
@Lamnguin I'm SURE they're just checking their diaries...
@Lamnguin No... no one else wants to play with me. You're my only friend...
@Lamnguin No... no one else wants to play with me. You're my only friend...
@Loudbasket @Alasdair_CM All the gear and no idea.
@SarahTregear @starlitwolf Poorly me &amp; not enough hours in the day!!
@thatpebbles @ColettePatterns @hartsfabric The blog is fabulous. You see how the picture translates to real life. Also lots of good advice.
Here @thatpebbles - same dress x https://t.co/WskRK4orNR
@thatpebbles @ColettePatterns @craftyplanet The thing I LOVE about sewers is they show the dresses on REAL women... hold on!
@thatpebbles @ColettePatterns @craftyplanet I don't have. Never have. I'll probably alter the skirt bit x
@Lamnguin Poor babies...
This frock is on my to do list. It's a LONG list.  https://t.co/suiYVENE3d
@Loudbasket @Alasdair_CM Or photographers...
@lardychap @wombat37 \"write 1000 words on broken stuff that we don't really know anything about\"
@Lamnguin I always think of Asterix when I see Menelaus. Him or Brian Blessed.
@starlitwolf SPLENDID!
@lardychap @wombat37 I can't even remember what my question is now...
@Lamnguin I thought you were talking about Asterix!!! I've had a HARD day.
@starlitwolf @SarahTregear Hello! How are you?
@Lamnguin I know :)
@nogbad Oh MY! I have clocked the ostrich but am saving it for a treat next week.
@DaisiesandPieUK Fibber ;)
@Lamnguin You're SO funny.  
@Lamnguin I DO feel bad. Not bad enough to cut my nose off &amp; refuse the offer...
@AlanPedigrew @aGirlcalledBoys @aslargy It works on shiny old-man beige poloshirts.
@Lamnguin Both?
@Lamnguin I might be going to see King George III after all: evening after day school. Mr &amp; Mrs Ken might be going &amp; will give me lift back.
@evermoreanon I have brogue envy.
@AlanPedigrew @aGirlcalledBoys @aslargy I iron slacks every Monday. I dampen the crease with my own tears.
@Lamnguin OBVS you!
@TheChaosBros It's a whole big luuuurve-fest.
@AlanPedigrew @aGirlcalledBoys @aslargy Slacks &amp; polo shirt.
@chickenprincess You're being reasonable x
The Iliad | Royal Lyceum Theatre Edinburgh https://t.co/LLvYHzO04B \n\nWho else wants to go to a Saturday matinee to see this?! April/May 2016
@Lamnguin Busy busy busy busy! All the scrubbing and all the cycling. Easier day tomorrow :)
I'm home. And knackered. BUT toad in the hole is happening. That will make everything better.
@DaisiesandPieUK #fairylightsareforlifenotjustforChristmas
@grumpynorthernc Stuupid jobs. Art galleries are little pockets of heaven. Also museums. I hide in museums a lot.
@PhotosSara Not half way up that hill!! He was a treasure :)
@malongoman It's lovely!
@aslargy Nope! Gently dreich &amp; mild.
@aslargy No flag - but I am greeted with a cup of tea when I arrive here!
@aslargy It's one of my favourites. 6.5km and I don't see another soul. Apart from the encouraging pedestrian in the village at the end.
Winter is coming #cycling #scottishborders @ Ednam https://t.co/VXdttR4d3g
Dear pedestrians: a cheery \"nearly there, love!\" is one of the nicest things you can say to a cyclist struggling up a hill.
@SuicideBiscuits No, not really!
@SuicideBiscuits It's not housework. It's my living.
And that's not a poor me tweet. I'm very grateful I've got work &amp; can feed my kids etc etc etc... I'd just rather not be doing it right now.
I know it's stating the bleedin' obvious but I'd much rather not be wearing Marigolds today. I have a head FULL of essay :/
@hughkeogh @aslargy @aGirlcalledBoys I went into labour with my 2nd on Selkirk Moor. That was an interesting drive.
@hughkeogh @aslargy @aGirlcalledBoys Selkirk is a lovely town. I used to live near it. Tricky to get to now without a car.
@wombat37 @defsmith Really good! I got the basic structure down and 250 good words. They'll need editing, but it's a good start.
@aslargy @hughkeogh @aGirlcalledBoys Me too. My boys have GORGEOUS accents. A mix of RP &amp; gentle Borders.
@defsmith @TheKittyWoo I do in my tweed skirts. I'm thinking of getting the specs. I think I'd suit those... https://t.co/Bb3NOpdrjG
@hughkeogh @aslargy @aGirlcalledBoys I can still say them beautifully. But not in a Scottish accent...
@hughkeogh @aslargy @aGirlcalledBoys *whispers* I can't actually say it properly! I'm an adoptee...
@aslargy @hughkeogh @aGirlcalledBoys Glorious in the Scottish Borders. In a gloriously dreich way.
@Lamnguin @LizzyWelshCake Same here! You'll be FAB x
@defsmith @TheKittyWoo They are very lovely. I feel like Miss Jean Brodie in them.
Dreich Wednesday morning Cheviots #cycling #scottishborders @ Houndridge https://t.co/EzIDwKnXXx
@TheKittyWoo @defsmith Here are my beloveds. I bought them with my first month's wages (the whole lot). https://t.co/bhh6at7ZAU
@MonaHelluvaLott Phew! I'm phewing a lot these days...
@AlanPedigrew And a clean shirt! #fancy
@MaudieStokes43 @thatpebbles I've counted three #notstalkinghonest
@MonaHelluvaLott Oh I've just realised. That was sarcasm, wasn't it? Sorry...
@defsmith @TheKittyWoo They don't have pretty nude brogues though. I do have a pair of brogues that are 31 years old... want to see?!
@defsmith @TheKittyWoo Mine are perfect ;)
@evermoreanon See last RT... they are beautiful.
@kernowbeeching I KNOW. I don't do shallow or materialistic very often but I'm FEELING it right now. It will pass...
@wombat37 @defsmith You don't understand us...
@defsmith And they don't have them online in my size....  https://t.co/3bQiRIlZmn
@defsmith Did you see them?
Not really weeping. A teeny tiny bit mis though.
Weeping for the shoes I'll never have #deeplyshallowtweet
@AlanPedigrew @TheKittyWoo I THINK there was enough for a peerage. I'll have to dig. Ex knew the family quite well. Obvs not asking him!
@AlanPedigrew @TheKittyWoo Tories like JCBs... #justsayin
@TheKittyWoo I checked my tweet before I sent it to make SURE I said pair 
@AlanPedigrew @TheKittyWoo Still way out. Spade?
@TheKittyWoo @AlanPedigrew He needs a bunker.
@TheKittyWoo I only saw a lovely 295 pair... Gave serious consideration to buying 2.
@AlanPedigrew @TheKittyWoo Don't you start, matey.
@MonaHelluvaLott I'm brilliant at other people's dating. I've decided this will be my new THING. Vicarious Dating Guru.
@MonaHelluvaLott Oh MONA! Send him a light-hearted, breezy \"had a lovely time yesterday, hope you did too\" type text after lunch today.
@TheKittyWoo Waaaaaaaaaah  They don't have my size!
@TheKittyWoo I am going over there right NOW!
@MonaHelluvaLott Early days. He's prob terrified of appearing too eager. Have you sent \"I had a lovely time\" text/email?
@TheKittyWoo Oh Kitten - I love these. Where?! Please tell me where to go!
@nogbad Oh darling, I've just seen this. X
@MonaHelluvaLott Forget the teabags, how was the date?
@Me_on_Tyne @Lamnguin Don't you mean suave Charles?
@Me_on_Tyne @Lamnguin I know you both love me really.
@Lamnguin @Me_on_Tyne I think you'll find I can. I shall tiara like I've never tiara'd before. Might go full coronet...
@Lamnguin @Me_on_Tyne Can I be your bridesmaid and best woman and EVERYTHING?! And HAT.
I have a structure, 250 words added to it and a whole pile of extra reading I want to do LATER. Which is lovely. And now Betty says BED.
@grumpynorthernc What kind of painting? I'm hopeless with brush/pencil. (I'm going to try &amp; break through that.) I'm more of a maker.
@lardychap @wombat37 That's a good one too! Just 1,000 for this one, but it's less narrative more piecing together odds &amp; sods from all over
@wombat37 @lardychap Yes. I'm off. I'm going to Pomodoro. That WORKS. Ta ra x
@ColinTheHuman I've heard about you chaps &amp; vacuum cleaner nozzles. Make sure you wipe thoroughly. Before &amp; afterwards.
@lardychap @wombat37 I can't do any more work on them until I've finished this essay. It's the LAW.
@lardychap @wombat37 I just sound it. I'm not it. I'm very happily quietly ordinary and it's LOVELY.
@SazeAlkin They can stay in their bedroom!
@ColinTheHuman I LOVE Sudafed! And menthol crystals. And steroid spray.
@ColinTheHuman I've had two weeks of that... it's not my best look.
@grumpynorthernc I'd rather be reading Homer. I like Homer. I'm not cut out to be an archaeologist I think. I like words.
@grumpynorthernc An essay on the life of a Greek pot. It's not going well. Or rather I'm not applying myself well!
I'm going to make a cup of tea and try tip tapping instead of scrawling. Then the words might flow...
@defsmith OOOOH!
@Lamnguin I'll get your coat 
@Lamnguin Can I have a pat on the head, too?
@defsmith I think they're my favourite kind of shop.
@Lamnguin I've had quite enough today, thank you. While I appreciate it ENORMOUSLY there's only so much my fluffy little brain can take.
The 2nd half of my essay is not going well. It holds 75% of the marks. I reckon I've caught 3 of them so far.
@defsmith Stewarts isn't a chain. It's an institution. And an emporium. With hidden delights.
@MonaHelluvaLott @TheFlossieTP Me too!!!
@defsmith Like our Stewart &amp; Sons Ironmongery?
@defsmith MY typo! What are Tiger tealights anyway? They sound like something I would like... 
@defsmith I'm looking forward to tomorrow when this is yesterday's typo ;)
@thes2the2 I agree. I don't have the time, inclination or imagination to write them though.
@TulipFairy Cosy is the best!
@thes2the2 No. I was being self-depracating. I'm writing an essay.
@lardychap @wombat37 I already sound posh ;)
Kids are washing up* and I'm off to write some words. I'm going to make up a story about an old Greek vase. \n\n*suddenly needing the loo
@EscapedHere @RubbishWife Betty had it too. She went through a stage of eating her own :/
This resonates. From setting foot into A&amp;E to being ambulanced to paediatric nephrology unit we were given TIME.  https://t.co/Evo2rwWe9l
@RidiculousMrsH Thank you. You've put into words how I was treated with my critically ill son. X
@YourMrBumbles @guardian Yes. Absolutely.
@YourMrBumbles oh thank you. You are lovely! xx
@DJTommyTrouble BEST way! Weird isn't it?
@porridgebrain I've got my vest on.
@DJTommyTrouble I've nuhearted you instead. #anticorporate
@DaisiesandPieUK Gannets!
@Justannienow @TheFlossieTP My eldest is 12. He's never been tested.
@TheFlossieTP @Justannienow @MonaHelluvaLott Oh doooooooooo! It would be lovely to meet you x
@Justannienow @TheFlossieTP @MonaHelluvaLott SOMEWHERE!
@MsAlliance #bosomsbebadonhalogenhobs. #bosomsbegoodelsewhere
@ebookwoman I'll wing it... :)
@TheFlossieTP @MonaHelluvaLott FAB!!! #weekendwithFloss
@MsAlliance I broke my halogen hob with pure bosom power. I had to tell the insurance company I dropped a pan on it.
@EscapedHere I've got a cat who begs for dried pasta.
@TheFlossieTP Let's do poppies. I was so upset I didn't make the effort to do That London.
@ebookwoman 
@ebookwoman The thing the schools do in conjunction with the church: send a shoebox of gifts to less privileged children.
@TheFlossieTP I'm getting very excited!! #weekendwithFloss
@TheFlossieTP Bugger off ;) xx (hello lovely)
@meatloaf1333 Yes. Thanks...
@meatloaf1333 I live with two children... I have an entire cupboard stocked with loo roll.
@meatloaf1333 They're already very regular. We do GOOD fruit &amp; veg!
@porridgebrain ;) https://t.co/3r4Ozql3bE
The kids have eaten a whole box of bran flakes in 2 days... I'm worried for my plumbing now :/
@hugeshark @QuantumTree @greythorne Me too :)
@wombat37 @QuantumTree @hugeshark @greythorne Northern - ask @Lamnguin
@QuantumTree @hugeshark @greythorne Are we all talking about the same kind of vest?! International language differences...!
@QuantumTree @hugeshark @greythorne We should start a vest support group.
@squadrat Indeed x
@MsAlliance @RubbishWife I'm still thinking. I'll wait until someone I have a crush on hearts a tweet.
@StiffPigeon @defsmith I wouldn't know about that sort of thing. Because #wholesome. And literate.
@RubbishWife @MsAlliance Or kittens. Or rainbows.
@StiffPigeon @defsmith No need. I can light a fire blindfolded.
See - it's CONFUSING. I feel LUUURVE but Twitter tells me it's only LIKE. https://t.co/Bo1U4rdHXk
@StiffPigeon @defsmith Poker
@greythorne @hugeshark I  vests.
@aslargy I proper love mine. Both of them. They genuinely listen and work hard for us. It feels like I'm really being represented.
@Lamnguin You don't have any heating because you're tight ;)
@fizzandnonsense HEARTING. \n\nNobody likes a smartarse ;)
@charlieIzzyTed And  for you. Told you I was simple!!!
@greythorne @hugeshark 
I'm going to make tea. And bake a cake. In the meantime please make the nature of your heating known. I'm a simple sort...
@defsmith @StiffPigeon I was poking HER  not YOURS. Just so we are clear...
@StiffPigeon you are not EVER getting your  poked. HORRID.
@RubbishWife @MsAlliance I'm hoping ;)
@aslargy Not yet 
@StiffPigeon Sexist. And RUDE.
@aslargy I DO write to my MP. I used to tweet him with gay abandon. Now I'm afeared.
See - an hour ago we were 'just good friends'. ONE  led to THIS... https://t.co/rRiEu79aZh
@aslargy Gah. Who asked us? NO ONE.
@MsAlliance Hello gorgeous ;)
@aslargy I was joking btw... you're safe. I promise. But crikey heck...
@RubbishWife ZACKLY.
@aslargy Oh it does a little explosion of joy too! Oh Lord it's all WRONG!
@GeorgiLoveland Daft buggers.
@RubbishWife Yes!
@aslargy Hey gorgeous!
@MsAlliance It's replaced the favourite star. Everything's gone from GREAT TWEET! to HOW YOU DOIN' ;) without warning.
@GeorgiLoveland I've just got rid of FB. I feel like it's coming back to haunt me.
@GeorgiLoveland Not yet...
Maybe we could have a Serious Heart &amp; a Flirty Heart?
I'm going to feel all self-conscious now with the heart thing. \n\nFor a minute or two anyway.
We've got a Christmas shoebox disaster: does anyone have a list they can send me a photo of, please?
@Lamnguin It's actually some parliamentary thing I think which did away with our real counties. @PaulWheelhouse might know?
@Lamnguin Every single day... poor tourists in Kelso ;)
@YourMrBumbles Oh WOW!
@YourMrBumbles @guardian HA! No - that came out pretty pretentiously: it wasn't in my head. I'd be concerned of a 'shrine' feel without b/g.
Kelso Abbey #scottishborders https://t.co/gl9wUwWUH1
Autumn sunshine #scottishborders @ Kelso, Scottish Borders https://t.co/a9tjX63A5v
@YourMrBumbles @guardian I think I'd be happier if the collection was shown against a backdrop of contemporaneous world/domestic events.
@YourMrBumbles @guardian I think I'd be happier if the collection was shown against a backdrop of contemporaneous world/domestic events.
@YourMrBumbles @guardian yes. I has a knee-jerk 'thank goodness' reaction this morning. I don't LIKE the idea but can see its relevance.
@Justannienow I can't begin to imagine how that must feel. I'm so sorry.
@MaudieStokes43 Oooh!
@Justannienow I'm SO glad we live in Scotland. I couldn't imagine putting my children under that pressure. For absolutely no good reason.
@YourMrBumbles @guardian Isn't the collection which is being offered too limited? If it had spanned her whole career, then maybe...
@MaudieStokes43 What are you making?
@MaudieStokes43 Can't wait to see!
I'll never not get spooked &amp; have to check 'find me by email' isn't ticked when I get a 'your contact x is now on Twitter'.
@barefootmower Ewwwww!
@YourMrBumbles I love fatuous fool almost as much as fuckwit! Maybe when he behaves better he can be promoted to that?
@ColinTheHuman Shame. We could have done swapsies.
@ColinTheHuman oooh!  Do you do audible?
Love love love MrsO \"oh Dotty you're still not right! Have a cuppa and don't stay long, dear.\"
@bopterror No apology necessary! I'd spend half my time on here apologising if that were the case ;)
@bopterror That's grim. And dull.
@bopterror So colleague not partner?
@greythorne @bopterror My only company at work brings ocassional talk of Tena pads &amp; emollient cream. Except Friday. Friday is baby day.
@bopterror Oh. That's tricky. I'm guessing you need to be involved/supportive?
@bopterror oh I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about other people going on about it. Now I feel bad. Genuinely sorry.
@bopterror Hello! Have you tried Notadiet? There's a book &amp; a blog &amp; everything*! It's so easy &amp; I feel GREAT!\n\nDoesn't work.\n*not true
@bopterror I am not on a diet. Some of us are out there. It's a tricky thing to be anything less than quiet about though.
@Loudbasket @savouryvinegar Phew x
@Loudbasket JUST like me ;)
@Loudbasket @savouryvinegar And hurrah! I did 274 for 1st part yesterday. Plan for part 2 &amp; some words tonight.
@Loudbasket @savouryvinegar That wasn't meant to be patronising. I looked back &amp; thought ouch. But you KNOW me :)
@defsmith @jamesrbuk @Davos Do they shower after both exercise AND connection? Or efficiently wait until after their commute?
@thes2the2 No. Only I can do that :)
@thes2the2 PS I knew ;) I was making a joke x
@thes2the2 Oh dear, how sad, never mind *skips back*
@greythorne Mine is only a year old. I feel so up with beauty trends!
I'd come put of my nunnery for the person who invented paracetamol. Not for long... don't get too excited.
@greythorne Wow! Why buy once when you can buy twice, hey?
@StiffPigeon https://t.co/uR6ALuwpa3
@wombat37 Yes! MrsB then MrsO. And I've found the dog! He was sleeping right at the back of his kennel. He's deaf, bless him.
@wombat37 I've found MrsB's slipper in the garden :/
@wombat37 Me too :( I'll go and check for a spade in the garden later.
Also new audiobook excitement. Didn't get that in the old days.
@wombat37 It would have a way to go. Tuesday's garden is LARGE. With high stone fortress walls.
Last tweet - you might think I swapped international jetset corporate life for one of stress-free scrubbing. How wrong you would be 
Tuesday morning's dog is not in his kennel. Tuesday morning's dog is old. BUT his indoor bed is still here *crosses fingers &amp; worries*
@Loudbasket Me irl writing my essay https://t.co/3LUJjmnOCj
@Loudbasket @savouryvinegar 100 words a day is a lot less stressful than the THING.
@Loudbasket @savouryvinegar I will make you something lovely as a reward for writing 100 words a day from now until it's submitted x
@AlanPedigrew @aGirlcalledBoys And on that giggle I'm off to work.
@AlanPedigrew @aGirlcalledBoys Oh DEAR! I don't seem to have enough money. How can I EVER?!
@AlanPedigrew @aGirlcalledBoys I used to write the synopses for those :)
@savouryvinegar @Loudbasket I've thrown sudafed at it, now it's paracetamol and I'm going to round off with bleach. Inhaled, not consumed.
@AlanPedigrew @PaulSmithDesign Fancy!
@savouryvinegar @Loudbasket I am incubating a mutant lurgy. Feeling pretty awesome - there's not many with this talent I think!!!
@savouryvinegar @Loudbasket Good morning ladies!
@aGirlcalledBoys @AlanPedigrew Do you have films you can pay extra for in your hotel telly?
@malongoman @graceleesmaffei Well thanks for that image! *picks up microfibre cloths with double Marigold protection*
@malongoman @graceleesmaffei I reckon the later stuff is polishing the newel posts at Holyrood :)
Hurrah for that... https://t.co/eDqFgYx6zt
@thes2the2 It ebbs &amp; flows ;)
@aslargy I've always thought that too. I try and avoid if I'm ever visiting That London.
@thes2the2 No - Charlie has his new bed.
@thes2the2 ANYTHING can lead to bickering. They are children in close proximity practising opinions &amp; argument.  It's completely natural :)
@aslargy I'm not a fan. I like fresh air. And I'm sure it does spread germs.
The bickering has started. Over Teddy's new bed. Which I'm saving up for. For the next year...
@aslargy Oh that's scary. I'm very glad I don't work anywhere near any aircon. Aircon scares me.
@aslargy Euch. I am not at home to unwell. It VEXES me. I'm glad it's not just me though.  Not glad it you, obvs, but you know...
@aslargy I am still battling this lurgy. Feeling a bit uncharacteristically sorry for myself this morning. Big bad sinus headache.
@aslargy Good morning, Raffles. How are you? Do you still have The Fog?
I love that no matter how much they bicker, the 1st boy awake always asks the other if he can switch the light on. A good start to the day.
@wombat37 @Lamnguin Vibrators vs washing machines. Trust me on this one...
@Lamnguin Bugger off. Night night you!
@Lamnguin I was reckoning on the hosepipe. Got off lightly!
@Loudbasket Night night gorgeous x
Late to bed again. I shall give myself a good ticking off. Night night chums x
@wombat37 @ekctafc That's PROPER funny. I laughed right down to my socks.
@Lamnguin FINE!
@YourMrBumbles You could do it too!
@wombat37 @ekctafc With the horse brasses hung at one side. And the Spanish fan on t'other.
@Lamnguin Yes dear!!
@YourMrBumbles @Desailaur Oh gosh that's beautiful.
@ekctafc @wombat37 Did she smell of Parma violets and gin?!
@ekctafc @wombat37 I'll show you Billy tomorrow. He's quite the thing.
@Lamnguin Yes, pet.
@YourMrBumbles Theoretically a degree in Classics. Whether I ever graduate is a different matter - but it keeps me sane.
@wombat37 Oh I KNOW. I did pretty good wobbling of time today. It was a GOOD day.
@Lamnguin HEAVENS. I don't know how you'll be able to sleep with the excitement!! (Keep it in the bathroom a while)
@ekctafc @wombat37 I think that was the problem - it didn't count if he hadn't killed it.   I dunno. It's on my sitting room floor now...
@wombat37 It's on my list. A very definite must tackle before I'm 50 thing.
@ekctafc @wombat37 I KNOW!
@Lamnguin Wow! Is it in your bathroom?
@wombat37 @ekctafc YES!!! He didn't like the wild boar either. Or my mum hated it... not sure which.
@Lamnguin What's this?
@wombat37 I've never tried. It's the last \"you can't\" thing from my childhood. I need to at least give it a go.
@wombat37 @ekctafc I used to buy rope and send it to my dad. I thought he'd be ever so pleased to get exotic foreign rope. He wasn't :(
@wombat37 @davidtims @evermoreanon No - none at all. I didn't own a camera - didn't seem important then. I should write some of it down.
@wombat37 @davidtims @evermoreanon Was a very real thing. I adored it. It will all have changed now. I was very lucky to be there then.
@nogbad GOSH! I'll grab it on catchup tomorrow. And drum up some ironing business.
@wombat37 @davidtims @evermoreanon When I lived in Poland the rope shop was next door to the ladder shop was next door to the screw shop.
@nogbad I haven't had the telly on today - no ironing, you see. Only watch telly when ironing.  It's the LAW.
@davidtims @evermoreanon Ahhh. I'll pop into the needle shop tomorrow &amp; ask. Thank you!
@chickenprincess @wombat37 Am I?!
@DaisiesandPieUK Made me the woman I am today.
@davidtims @evermoreanon I'm  flummoxed. I'll give some to a chum and see how it behaves on her machine...
@chickenprincess You're not talking about my one more comment like that and you're out list are you?!
@chickenprincess I know. Last week's cull told me \"you must have a very dull life\". So rude.
@chickenprincess Yes. But I cleared one off The List last week. I don't want to do too many in one go...
@fizzandnonsense \"Don't you have any friends?!\"\n\nSilly woman.
MrsM played another blinder this morning. For the record, if someone tells you they're spending Christmas alone, the best response isn't
@DaisiesandPieUK When I was little we had minis with gravy to start, big sliced pud with roast then minis with gs &amp; cream for pudding.
@lardychap FleaBay innit :)
@ginlington Use a higher proportion of butter though: 100g to 180g of flour, otherwise it's too short.
@lardychap I do! But I bought this. With actual money.
@lardychap My bottom seems to have required mist of the acreage...
@lardychap From India! It was exported in a gorgeous stitched muslin envelope.
@lardychap It isn't a sari any longer! It's nearly pyjama bottoms. If I don't throw it in the bin...
@lardychap I'd go with the latter and then mention something about the Latin.
@ginlington Try spelt pastry too - it's delicious.
@lardychap Oh dear.
@DaisiesandPieUK Ha! That's what we did for pudding today :)
@fizzandnonsense the silk dulling the needles?  (I'm on my third now on a project which shouldn't even use the life of one)
Does anyone have any experience machine #sewing Indian sari silk? Having a big problem with breaking thread. Not sure if machine or
@nogbad My sewing machine is occasionally bad-tempered...
@nogbad I can't get to it! I'm in my bedroom. WITH THE SEWING MACHINE NOT BEING RUDE.
@nogbad I've had to save the llamas for something else! Don't know what yet...
@meatloaf1333 It's a treat hat :)
Have worn work hat, learnin' hat and mum hat today. Time for me hat.
@Mulrain I bet it's lovely x
@Mulrain Oh that's another GRAND thing! And gratification far less delayed. My PJ bottoms will last longer than your bread though ;)
@Mulrain I stick to the basics: but I genuinely do find it a brilliant escape from STUFF. It's nice to have something to run to.
@MsAlliance still 6 weeks. Not sure I can afford 6 weeks worth of fabric!
@Mulrain It's been a brilliant discovery for me. I have to concentrate so hard there isn't room for anything else! Tbf I'm of little brain 
@canuckuk @carolJhedges Ha ha ha!
I'm going to have to do sewing tonight. To get rid of the Rob fuckwittery #thearchers
@MsAlliance Can they really spin it out to Christmas?
@ginlington @chickenprincess Yep.
Eating down the pub... bastard. Been there. He won't come back tonight either. Nothing like a night away to up the guilt #thearchers
@chickenprincess I don't think it can tbh... yes: brilliantly done. I feel sick listening to him. So chilling.
OH GOOD WOMAN, HELLUN! #thearchers (she's going to be sorry within the next 12 hours )
@ebookwoman @PookyH I did not see that... ;)
Oooh I'm all caught up with #thearchers. I can listen tonight!!!
@FunkyPrawn I'm going to keep everything crossed lovely. And I'll surprise you with a ping when you least expect it x
@ebookwoman @PookyH YES!! I'm going to be an irritating old crone in a few years. I don't care. The cats won't mind ;)
@NiColaCubes I have two very happy children :)
@ebookwoman @PookyH Yes! Pliny is REAL and relevant. And even Pericles - his funeral oration could be delivered today (variations are).
@aslargy Is good 
@ebookwoman @PookyH Cool! I like it more for the critical thinking side of things than anything else. Plus not much changes.
You can take the girl out of Yorkshire... https://t.co/HX82b0d7IK
@ebookwoman @PookyH Greek &amp; Latin &amp; philosophy &amp; broken pots &amp; stuff :)
@ebookwoman I've been using Yooftube meditations to help me go back to sleep.
@Rainbow_Worrier Yep... it does make me wonder how the press would react if it was a leader of any of the other parties.
@RubbishWife I think knowing what to expect doesn't help :/
@RubbishWife Oh heck. If you need an empathetic poked mouth shoulder - I'm here x
This isn't going to get old any time soon... https://t.co/NUb3tDpq2Y
Wiser than a wise thing... https://t.co/NbEhRkodly
@RubbishWife Euch :( when is the next round?
@PookyH That makes my heart SWELL with happiness xx
@PookyH Yes I remember! How is he?
@PookyH oh still the Classics stuff. I took a break, but back to it now.
@PookyH Noooo. OU-ing!
@Loudbasket Yep.
@PookyH I did 250 in 2 hours 
@thatpebbles *weeps*
@thatpebbles Again - not THAT good. Or would that be bad?!
@wombat37 That's a motto for life, Wombie...
@Lamnguin oh Lord. That @defsmith has a lot to answer for...
@TLB73 @wombat37 @dylanhm Ha ha ha ha!!! That's dreadful on SO many levels.
@wombat37 Oooh. I've never tried that.  We just do butter &amp; salt. Unsalted butter &amp; salt 
@thatpebbles You know I'm standing here clenching them now, don't you?!!
@Lamnguin Oh KEITH...
@thatpebbles My bottom muscles are good, but not THAT good ;)
@wombat37 I know! It GRIEVES me. No - just steamed. The boys aren't keen on mayonnaise things. Also COLD. We need WARM.
@wombat37 I don't wear trackies! Except when tracking. I'm going to have to put the heating on :/
@Loudbasket My sister hashtags EVERYTHING. And misspells most of them. I posted one this morning but then deleted it. It wasn't kind.
@Lamnguin You'll get scurvy. I have NO idea how you've avoided it so far...
I'm warming my bottom on the oven door. Trying to work out a way I can chop the cabbage at the same time.
@chickenprincess Pie is a euphemism. I'm pure hug x
@chickenprincess YOU get the train up. I'll make you all the pies. And you can drink wine.  I won't mind at all. I'll sit with my tea &amp; pour
@chickenprincess Gah. Xx
@chickenprincess Oh I'd be CROSS about that. And there would be sitting down for WORDS.
@chickenprincess No one does, poppet. Except mad bloggers. And they're not real. That's Theresa May getting extra kicks.
@chickenprincess Oh...
@thes2the2 I don't have any but you can if you wish!
Help put a stop to this senseless waste of good food: join me by signing Hugh's #wastenot pledge now! https://t.co/CmoJkeyINu
@thatpebbles Emojis lose a lot in translation!!!
@thes2the2 Last of the new potatoes, steamed white cabbage &amp; carrots.
@thatpebbles Oh you're using fancy pants iPhone emojis... I can't see them!
@nogbad You'd give me 20 anyway. I'd just have to bribe you with pork pies ;)
Mum hat now... best get tea cooking. Anyone for roast chicken?
@nogbad Definitely red on black. That's one mark at least!
@Ca_Metzger Classics. I'll be dead or addled before I ever get the degree, but studying for it keeps me out of trouble.
@Ca_Metzger I'm aspiring to be able to write 5000 words of fact rather than 500 words of 'amsuingly imaginative story'. Quote my last tutor.
@Ca_Metzger I'm learning not to freeze when asked to describe a 2\" fragment of mosaic. And expand \"it's a 2\" fragment...\" to 500 words
@Ca_Metzger A biography of this vase. Without the lid...\nhttps://t.co/f33AzYCY9h
1st 1/4 of my assignment done. I'm a GOOD student. I've bribed myself with 50 towards my sewing machine if I finish this week.
1st 1/4 of my assignment done. I'm a GOOD student. I've bribed myself with 50 towards my sewing machine if I finish this week.
@thatpebbles @ebookwoman That's what my ex is stored as in my phone. I can't put Dickhead Fuckwit Arse because sometimes the boys use it.
Essay motivation is here at last!\n\n*hangs up DO NOT DISTURB sign*
@Lamnguin oh that's lovely!
@thatpebbles I'm a bling hypocrite. I love sparkly, but shiny makes me shiver!
@thatpebbles @Selfridges @OffspringShoes nope - I shan't fight you for those :)
@thatpebbles Then I'll have to do without. Sewing is my sanctuary at the moment. Boots wouldn't have saved me from Friday night's f-wittery
@thatpebbles I'll wait until they are slightly less ruinous ;)
@thatpebbles https://t.co/TOOEv43gAA
@thatpebbles They MIGHT be in the sales after Christmas. If they are - make me buy them.
@thatpebbles GAH. Am NOT. Half my sewing machine. Sewing makes me happy. Melts away fuckwittery. Sewing machine saving wins.
@thatpebbles I am NOT going to buy the same boots you have that are 1/2 the sewing machine of my dreams.\n\n*AM
Oh Lord. Miss Jean Brodie is younger than me...
@StiffPigeon Ah yes. I haven't experienced that particular agony, but I have witnessed* it.\n\n*caused with unbridled glee.
@StiffPigeon I pluck. Always pluck, never shave. That's the secret to mature beauty.
@StiffPigeon I take after her in many ways.
@StiffPigeon That's my Great Great Aunt Annie!
@nogbad The Classics is a harsh, cruel mistress.
@YourMrBumbles Hmmm. \"Oh Doris - I'd NEVER have had you down as someone who likes the BALLET!!\"\n\nI'm smiling *that* smile at her.
@thatpebbles I love her.
@thatpebbles Please tell me she was wearing tweed!
@YourMrBumbles You're welcome! Your day is still better than mine so far. I've got the doughty MrsM this morning reading the Express to me.
Current status: listening to The Prrrime of Miss Jean Brrrodie &amp; gazing wistfully out at the fog. The windows are getting a good clean.
Hand signal then got turned into thumbs up &amp; I got a wave in return. Happy me &amp; happy driver. #cycling
I've managed to turn my right hand turn signal into \"Don't you bloody DARE try &amp; overtake me here\". #cycling SKILLZ.
@aslargy @AlanPedigrew I have no idea how I'll manage over the Pennines, now...
@aslargy @AlanPedigrew I certainly used to impress myself. And then I woke up and realised ;)
@aslargy @AlanPedigrew Beer used to improve my Polish. And German. And Russian. I think it even had me speaking Latvian once. Or twice.
@aslargy @AlanPedigrew You're not talking toes are you?
@AlanPedigrew @grumpynorthernc @aGirlcalledBoys You should have worn your scarf. And mittens.
@MsCatMinder13 Awww! Yes. She IS. I love her.
@AlanPedigrew @aslargy Oh you two! I tried surfing once. That's as close as I've ever got to any kind of board sport. I got wet.
@AlanPedigrew @grumpynorthernc @aGirlcalledBoys How's the WEATHER? Anyone for a nice cup of tea?
@AlanPedigrew @aslargy I'd be sore afeared.
@grumpynorthernc @AlanPedigrew @aGirlcalledBoys I thought GOSH. There's being open and there's GOSH.
@TLB73 I love normal. I'm such a happily dull creature :)
@aslargy @AlanPedigrew Do I need to go to Urban Dictionary for that?
@grumpynorthernc @AlanPedigrew @aGirlcalledBoys Eeep! Good morning - FAB avi, lady.
@aslargy @AlanPedigrew I think we can just agree that I'm generally proper in all things.
@AlanPedigrew @aslargy I love the train. Probs not the train you're on. We have LOVELY trains up here. On time. With seats &amp; everything.
@aslargy @AlanPedigrew Oh yes, yes I am! *waxes it vigorously*
@aslargy @AlanPedigrew I'd look silly on a skateboard. Also I'd fall off.
@TLB73 Splendid! Finally shifting this horrid virus. Might try a run later today. Still not up to early morning though. How are you?
That last RT for @YourMrBumbles - with a smile :)
@TLB73 Good morning Tim!
@EscapedHere And cycling ;)
@AlanPedigrew @aslargy I'm cycling along misty leafy country roads for my commute. Soz ;)
@lardychap I'll look out for it. I saw the Devizes one because I used to live down there.
@malongoman Oh gosh yes! Vosene &amp; Wright's Coal Tar soap.\n\nI wanted to smell of Pears :(
@lardychap I've only seen one episode: I'm going to grab them on catchup when the next batch of ironing comes in (shd have been yesterday)
@malongoman It gets better. Did you polish your shoes?
@lardychap Yes, that's the one. I adore them.
@MsCatMinder13 Why shriek?
@thatpebbles @ebookwoman I've written 'My life, my future, my choice' in my little notebook.
@ebookwoman I should write a book on productive procrastination.
@Ca_Metzger That made me smile lots. You are wonderful x
@nogbad None at all. No touching...
@malongoman We're such movers &amp; shakers! How did you enjoy BB?
@YourMrBumbles @DollyBlacksheep Eeep - just seen. Hope all is well. Or at least getting better x
@DicksterW They are rascals. And then there are the cats :/
@ebookwoman @thatpebbles I did exactly the same ;)
@ebookwoman @thatpebbles Ah yes: \"Act don't React\" maybe?
@MoorseyL She's moved herself. She's under my legs now!
@DicksterW I used to have a lurcher too... if I still had her now I'd probably be sleeping on the sofa!
@MsAlliance Daft isn't it?
Betty has other ideas... https://t.co/MtwUembV7L
@ebookwoman @thatpebbles https://t.co/xdb1yI6Thi
Going to give sleeping in the middle of the bed another go tonight. I reckon it's time to let go of the edge.
@Lamnguin COURSE they did! I'm off to bed - night night 
@Lamnguin oh OUCH!
I'm late for bed. Naughty me.
@Lamnguin I wouldn't. I'd be very stoical &amp; insist I was FINE. Then fall over and die quietly, quickly &amp; without any fuss.
@Lamnguin They could do with rushing La Boheme a bit. Mimi doesn't half go on...
@nogbad Easy! And it's bound to be red &amp; black. I get extra points for noticing whether it's red on black or black on red...
@Lamnguin Isn't there a matinee? Oh - we've plenty of time. We can work something out/find something else.
@nogbad Do not worry - I've got it covered. I'll plan tomorrow after noon and then do 150 words a day like a focussed firster.
@Lamnguin This?\nhttps://t.co/OQYHSsWQgb
@thatpebbles I don't want to know the reason why: that's her business and shouldn't be anyone else's. Grrrrr.
@Lamnguin I'm ON IT.
@ekctafc Night night sweetheart x
@Lamnguin *weeping*
@Lamnguin MUD! Oh my - FROM THE GRAVE. Like Giselle but with shoulder-action.
@YourMrBumbles Oh that's putting a much shinier gloss on it than it deserves! I run two, actually - but both are just me with the odd helper
@Lamnguin We'll have to find something BETTER.
@chickenprincess I don't want her homework....
@chickenprincess I'll get the airbed blown up. She'll be BEGGING for that craft box. I'll have her trained in pie-making first. My gift.
@Lamnguin Yes. Shame though. I bet that would have been ever so good.
@chickenprincess Send her here. She'll soon be pining to be back ;)
@chickenprincess And helping with the housework &amp; gardening...
@Lamnguin Oh YES! But I'm narked because I can't do King Charles III - I've got day school on 21st. We'll have to find ANOTHER THING.
@chickenprincess Call yourself a mother?!  TSK.
@GigerPunk BUGGER. I knew I forgot something else! Shall I do double sashaying tomorrow?
@Lamnguin Yes. I think the cluttered boiler cupboard was blocking my ying. Or yang. Or chi. or SOMETHING.
@Loudbasket @kidd_kong78 I hope she's got a good darning mushroom.
@thatpebbles Oh I SEE! I'm fully employed not being at home to Mr Fuckwittery. Anything else is a bonus!
@Loudbasket @kidd_kong78 Ewwwww! She'll be darning socks til kingdom come!
I've undone a sewing cock-up, ironed, cleaned out the boiler cupboard, meal-planned, shopped and invoiced. I have not essayed. Again.
@thatpebbles @ebookwoman Oooh - a 4th resolution for what?!
@delphwynd Triangles are ACE. Triangles plus a splash of yellow are super ace,
@delphwynd Oooh. I like the colour version better! WHO KNEW?!
@ClareMBrown1 @robertshaplik1 He will. Back home now so he'll get decent sleep &amp; decent food.  X
@ClareMBrown1 @robertshaplik1 Yep. And he's had a sandwich for lunch, a bucket of popcorn &amp; a sandwich for tea so he's extra out of sorts :/
@ClareMBrown1 @robertshaplik1 I'm cleaning out my boiler cupboard to avoid my sleep-deprived grumpy youngest child.
THIRDED - heavenly telly https://t.co/nkp8SdZLyM
The boys have been dropped off early. They're hungry. I'm practising indifference. Cool, nonchalant indifference. \n\nAnd feeding them.
@thes2the2 Don't you dare!! You lovely lovely man - but please don't.  I like to work for these things. It's important. You know it x
@ClareMBrown1 @savouryvinegar That's enjoy that someone else had dusted. Not enjoy me sitting on you. Obvs.
@ClareMBrown1 @savouryvinegar I would come round and sit on your lap and MAKE you be still and enjoy it for at least a minute.
@savouryvinegar @ClareMBrown1 I wouldn't.  I'd sit with a huge mug of tea and grin from ear to ear.
@savouryvinegar @ClareMBrown1 SILLY BILLY!!!!
@savouryvinegar @ClareMBrown1 Oh no - no one has ever done any housework for me! But when b/f used to visit I made the effort.
@thes2the2 I need to wait anyway: I've just had to correct the most basic cockup on the pyjamas I'm making... it wasn't the machine's fault!
@savouryvinegar @ClareMBrown1 \n\"it was a PUN!!\"\n*THUD*
@savouryvinegar @ClareMBrown1 It's where having a boyfriend was quite useful. I did get my own housework done reasonably regularly.
@ClareMBrown1 @savouryvinegar OH. Oh lordy I'm a thicky today!!!!
@thes2the2 I like to have things to look forward to :)
@savouryvinegar @ClareMBrown1 Mine is \"oh bugger someone is actually going to come IN!\" Nobody has for a while...
@savouryvinegar @ClareMBrown1 I've given up. Pestering them and beating them ;) We do sporadic muck-outs. Like having ponies.
@thes2the2 Isn't it BEAUTIFUL? I'm going to save up. I reckon it's worth it just for the automatic threading! https://t.co/Ekz0PiLROi
@thes2the2 Do you want to see a picture?!
@kernowbeeching Janome. They're not as expensive as I thought. Which adds to the bad.
@dbrereton Mine is locked but if I post to Twitter, followers on Twitter can see.
@wombat37 MICHAEL!
@kernowbeeching They're so beautiful.  And they PROMISE never to jam ;)
@wombat37 Just looked. Not THAT bad. I may have to take some time off to go to John Lewis. For the stroking.
@scaryduck Lordy...
I've made the huge mistake of looking online at new sewing machines. Bad, bad, BAD me.
@MIkef45 @malongoman See you in a few weeks...
@wombat37 @lardychap You look JUST LIKE Brad Pitt!
@ekctafc @lardychap @wombat37 Bless!
@lardychap @wombat37 I think we should...
@wombat37 @lardychap Ha! You should see the picture I keep in the attic ;)
@lardychap @wombat37 It was at some IT/desktop publishing conference I went to. When I thought I was far more important than I ever was!
@lardychap If it hadn't been for @wombat37's fab idea &amp; the other contributors I'd never have thought of doing it. SO glad :)
#SUNDAYPIXtime 26 years... &amp; picked up 2 little urchin poppets along the way https://t.co/UOHaLXH9TP
@ekctafc Thanks!
@lardychap #cough
@lardychap I couldn't love her more. Not had a squeak to deal with :)
#SUNDAYPIXtime He'll KILL me for this... Teddy. #1 Boychild https://t.co/8mK1UcDpAf
@lardychap Bell transferred the day I got nuBike.
@lardychap I know! I feel a bit ansty - but hated the thought of bikes doing nothing 'just in case'. Far better they are used.
I've just met the loveliest man. I know salt of the earth is an overused phrase, but he really is. My old bikes are going to do good :)
@nogbad My cup runneth over ;)
@nogbad The greengrocer shopping is always a treat. 2 trips to Lidl is middling treat. Silly vases: can't wait!!
@nogbad I got a month's worth of treat yesterday. I'm not complaining :)
@nogbad Ironing, then seeing a man about an orphanage in the Ukraine, then shopping trips x3, then silly vases! No tutu time :(
@matsyendrasana OH. I don't have the technology for that! Or the time to appreciate it. With you now :)
The small apples are small because they were picked off the tree about a month before they were ripe. I've just found out. My poor boys...
Because I have been poorly I ordered some apples from the supermarket instead of skipping to my greengrocer. I bought small ones...
@nogbad Good morning, lovely you!
@nogbad I did think about making that pun, but got a grip JUST IN TIME
@matsyendrasana HD?
@wombat37 Thank you, treasure!
Betty &amp; leaves https://t.co/F8CLnFNHmv
@TLB73 Ach no: rubbish! I think my head was full of ballerinas and loveliness. Worth it though :)
And ironing... before the next lot is delivered. Guilt-free telly time though ;) Silver linings &amp; all that...
@TLB73 Morning, lovely!
@computerdan Yes, quite - I don't really buy into the technicalities. It's all about the feel for me. And I know that photo has it :)
@computerdan *whispers* Nothing's actually in focus! I don't care though - a happy boy in a happy place. That'll do me.
#SUNDAYPIXTIME Me time (and I'm finished now!) https://t.co/tKos4MeHs0
@computerdan Thanks. It was a lucky shot. One of my faves. I must get it printed.
@meatloaf1333 Good to hear! And thanks :)
@meatloaf1333 Fabulous thank you! How are you?

@tobhk This is true... See: it's all relative. ALL of it. And pretty much totally made up. Make up a jolly good story is my advice. I do ;)
Tea's up! Good morning, world out there.
Time to switch off. Fab day - huge thanks to my best chum @Lamnguin. X
@ekctafc @wombat37 I've been trying for thirty years. Time to give up.
@wombat37 @ekctafc I've decided to enjoy my remaining decades without that worry :)
@ekctafc @wombat37 Yep. I know :)
@wombat37 I'm pretty proud of me. Had a lot of support - hugely grateful for it.
@wombat37 @ekctafc If I could stop before getting ratarsed I wouldn't be an alcoholic!
@nogbad I'm not sure she does either! The music bit is 'nonsense - just ignore it'.
@ekctafc @wombat37 Fill your boots! I'm revelling in hangover-free mornings. Sheer heaven.
@ekctafc More Carrie Bradshaw than Margot Fonteyn
@nogbad I'll tell my tutor that. I do love her VERY much.
@ekctafc One for me, one for my twin cousin then there's a huge line of chums wanting one afterwards.
@wombat37 Oh well you must drink my share too! I hope you're braced. I could sink quite a bit...
@nogbad Well you'd THINK. Pesky Italians buried LOADS though. Safely.
@wombat37 Poppet - I'm a recently accepted/discovered/realised whatever the term is alcoholic. No booze!!!
@tobhk Oh they're lovely - but not exactly modern history? Sort of in the middle history, no?
@defsmith My soul is full and my smile is wide.
@lardychap Jeremy Brett played Miss Haversham?!
@wombat37 I'm always up early!
@lardychap Yes. Although Gillian Anderson was a WONDERFUL Miss Haversham. No stale talcum powder there...
I was going to write an essay on a Greek vase tomorrow. I want to make a tutu.
@lardychap Ha! Sorry poppet. There was a slight air of Miss Haversham, but only the tiniest whiff. Actually quite chilling.
@lardychap All the death. Cold, implacable, beautiful death. Transcendent. Didn't really wear tutu! Wore smart frock instead.
@lardychap Yes! That's what I was thinking. First act didn't really do it for me - pretty &amp; bouncy, but a bit meh. 2nd act BLEW ME AWAY.
@lardychap Is bought the farm a new euphemism?!
@lardychap Is bought the farm a new euphemism?!
And seamless connection with bus home. Today is the day which keeps on giving!
@TheFlossieTP always leave something to aim for ;)
@wombat37 My malt is #wholesome
@wombat37 Gosh that's racy...
@PookyH Happy birthday, darling girl. Sending all the love xx
@TheFlossieTP Ha ha ha!!
@wombat37 No booze!!! I'll have a big mug of Horlicks :)
@wombat37 Nope: had 2 old bikes up for freecycle. Two no shows, about to tip. Just got email from chap wanting them for Ukraine orphanage.
@TheFlossieTP Awwww! I'm so glad xx
@wombat37 Me too! I'm going to be smiling ALL week on the back of today. And I've got extra to smile about tomorrow too.
@TheFlossieTP Good lunch?! Xx
@wombat37 YES! And some tears, but they're fine too.
@TheFlossieTP I've got that lovely feeling of smiling from inside out x
My soul is all full up again. 30 isn't a lot to pay for a luxury like that, is it?
@JustJimWillDo Ha ha! No - it's my chum @Lamnguin
@thatpebbles I shall look forward to it!

@defsmith similar! Ballet. Was waiting for the chaps to come on after the encore and do a haka in solidarity.
Well they saved everything for the 2nd half. Cried like a baby. Pure heaven. #giselle
@FunkyPrawn Needed giant-sized.
@StiffPigeon Rude. And horrible.

Embra! https://t.co/TQKIRcGYo9
This is TRUE. I can hear them. https://t.co/vmi76aiSqP
@Ca_Metzger Oh I shall! I'm very excited. It's such a treat :)
@nogbad Well YES, quite!
The train also goes to one of those fancy out of town shopping city things. Not my cup of tea, but I can see it could be useful for 'others'
@nogbad It's FULL! The bus to Embra was never this full!
And a tweed mini skirt.
My studying so far has involved skim reading Kabyle pots &amp; planning in detail the construction of a mustard ponte di Roma dress.
@Lamnguin Hands off. It's OURS now.
@TheFlossieTP @GreyStellaGrey Oh LORD. How absolutely bloody awful. He's a double shit. I'm so sorry :(
@Lamnguin you're safe.  I'm busy glaring at the man opposite who's talking VERY LOUDLY on his phone.
@Lamnguin Is it my turn now? 
I'm on that train to Edinburgh I said I'd never have use for. Again! I'm such a ninny.
@lomelindi12 There's time for mine ;)
@lardychap @defsmith is it very wrong that I get excited about natural-fibre thermal undergarments?
@defsmith @lardychap *curtsies*
@uberbobs @TheFlossieTP *trembles*
@lomelindi12 Yep. I have my theories ;)
@defsmith @lardychap What about rubber?
@defsmith @LizzyWelshCake @lardychap YES.
@lomelindi12 EXACTLY. \"Time to go home. NOW.\"
I've been getting myself into SUCH a pickle about my first TMA for this course. Just checked &amp; I've got 11 days left to procrastinate! #ou
@uberbobs @TheFlossieTP Have you parcelled them up with brown paper &amp; string?!
@lardychap @defsmith If you had my hormones you wouldn't.
@lomelindi12 #notallparents ;) Morning lovely
@defsmith @lardychap We should ALL wear tutus. The world would be a better place.
@lardychap @defsmith You need to go a-line. It's the most flattering cut.
@uberbobs @TheFlossieTP ermmmm *backtracks quickly*
@lardychap Thank you. Hurrah for #cycling!!!
@lardychap I've got my vest on. Don't worry!
@TheFlossieTP @uberbobs I'll go with whatever. Oh what a pity I won't have the poppets. Well have to arrange another day trip later :)
We're ready! https://t.co/1N3RVQKT4Y
@TheFlossieTP @GreyStellaGrey OH. Still, solidarity, eh?
@TheFlossieTP @GreyStellaGrey I'm saving it for the bus!
@uberbobs @TheFlossieTP Wouldn't ALL of us be the best thing ever? AND all the #varmints
@TheFlossieTP @uberbobs No I haven't and I would love that VERY VERY much! Yes PLEASE!! XXXX
@uberbobs @TheFlossieTP HA!!! No chance of that. On soooooo many levels!!!!
@TheFlossieTP @uberbobs Giselle!
@uberbobs @TheFlossieTP I've got mine already. AND I'm showered and fragrant.
@Me_on_Tyne @Lamnguin He's fibbing. He's had it ages on 'permanent loan' ;)
@RubbishWife It's a bonkers time...
@JustJimWillDo @lardychap Your knowledge of crocheted knickers is starting to worry me, Jim...
@lardychap No opera gloves for the matinee #rules. Crochet is like knitting but with one stick.
@RubbishWife Ooof - poor you! (She says suddenly fanning herself!)
@RubbishWife Oh no! I've not had a daytime one yet - mine are still all at night.
@lardychap Crocheted. For best.
@JustJimWillDo Aye! But don't worry - I'll have had me tea!
@RubbishWife Oh ME TOO *clutches handbag under bosom*
@Lamnguin What about a vest? I'm wearing a vest.
@RubbishWife Thermals ftw!
@RubbishWife Of COURSE she did!
@Lamnguin Morning! Have you got your tutu ready?
@JustJimWillDo That very one!!
@RubbishWife I made myself giggle though!!
@VisceralCuties You've got to be careful of claws, see - especially near your face. I can get away with finger b/c he thinks I'm stroking
Ballet today. In the big city. I'm going to wear a frock &amp; everything. And big knickers &amp; a vest b/c Embra is CHILLY.
@VisceralCuties Shhh! Don't tell anyone! (I wiped it on the cat)
Good morning world! My little coffee-slaves are away :/ The positive is that I get to have tea instead.
@VisceralCuties I was not! Morning :)
Oh kitten... https://t.co/jdkkAPiEZf
@CeriLD I give up. I don't begin to understand a thing about economics - but even I can see that's madness.
@CeriLD WHAT?!
@YourMrBumbles HA! I didn't even see that! I'd make a rubbish proofreader these days! I appreciated the sentiment. That's what is important
@ebookwoman It's a bitch to cut! Slipping all over the place...
@MsAlliance I made them tea. They were hungry. He arrived. I made him wait in the car until they'd finished. Petty but satisfying.
@ebookwoman You're very brave!
@YourMrBumbles *Practise #pedant ;)\n\nOn a more serious note: yes - you're absolutely right. Next time x
Off to sew. Sewing sorts my head out. That &amp; running.
@thatpebbles oh yes - I'm not that good!
@thatpebbles Not really. And these are drawstring waist which makes it easier.
@MirandaWhiting Sorry - thought that was in response to later tweet. Instead of Merlot...
@MirandaWhiting No. I'm teetotal now.
@ColinTheHuman I don't think I will ever dare risk another fuckwit ever again Colin.
@ebookwoman Eeek. I have touching eye phobia.
@ebookwoman This looks like the place I got mine from: can't guarantee as it was a while back!\nURL: https://t.co/tdGBp3ZSmA
@ebookwoman eBay.  I'll hunt the shop out for you.
@ebookwoman Mine are from a sari second. Found a place in India who export them for not very much at all :)
@VisceralCuties @Anchorcake @Loudbasket I have no idea what's going on here.
@Mariam_Kobras I'd hurt myself with ANY drink Mariam. X
@evermoreanon I like that.
No salmon tonight. Pantry supper much safer option.
@Lamnguin You are my very favourite ex in the whole wide world. Anyway you're not ex. You're promoted to BFF x
Drink is not the answer to fuckwittery.\n\nRepeats and repeats and repeats and repeats.
My ex is poster boy fuckwit.
Ex says he's going to be an hour late. Again. Which means he'll be nearer 2 hours late. He tells me this at 6pm: pick up time.
@ekctafc @defsmith @Lamnguin Gosh.
@Loudbasket People who follow accounts with 1500 followers &amp; no interactions #alsonames
@ekctafc @defsmith @Lamnguin I don't own one. I have to use one though. The extension pipe is rigid which is limiting.
@ekctafc @defsmith @Lamnguin They are heavy, cumbersome, the flex &amp; hose are too short and the attachments are inadequate.
@ekctafc @defsmith @Lamnguin I am anti Dyson and anti Sebo but very pro Vax.
@Lamnguin I'll get him some waders.
@Lamnguin @defsmith Ha!
@Lamnguin I'm going out to catch* a salmon.\n\n*off to @LidlUK
@defsmith phew. I was almost missing it.

Oh how very very marvellous!!!! https://t.co/iEEuJ7eGov
@louisehector @PerrymansBuses They're that too!!
@louisehector @PerrymansBuses That was a sentence needing an Oxford comma if ever there was one 
@louisehector Yes I can see it would be. I don't have a car, but the bus service we do have is reliable at least.
@louisehector @PerrymansBuses in the Borders are FAB. Always on time, clean &amp; lovely drivers. Just not many of them!
I'm all hot &amp; bothered now :/ #bathtweets
@aslargy FossilBoy...
@aslargy And bits of rock that I stand on accidentally.
@aslargy For tissues &amp; dog biscuits #notquitesoracynow
This Friday's bottle of Merlot will be the start of silk pyjama bottoms. With pockets.
@RubbishWife Bubble bath &amp; everything. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON!
Arses. https://t.co/zRFfvYw8gz
@BronwynRugby Thank you! It's going very well x
@theweeyin15 Bless!
@BronwynRugby No - I'm teetotal as of 2 weeks &amp; 3 days ago :)
@ebookwoman Fab, thank you x
My house is full of little boys just being little boys. I'm going to run a hot bath, lock the door and just grin for a bit.
@simonpjbest I've honestly never seen Scotland look more beautiful than it does this autumn.
@theweeyin15 Squeee!!
@simonpjbest Hello Simon! Scotland welcomes you!
@lomelindi12 Yes. But relatively short-lived and worth it to be back to normal.
Marigolds are away! I love my Friday ladies.
@lomelindi12 It's better now!
@porridgebrain @qikipedia you beat me to that reply!
@RubbishWife Not as hard as it used to make driving!
@ebookwoman I'll give them a go. Did you get the ones with elastane?
Why have you lot not told Toby that he's devastatingly attractive? Shame on you, Twitter... https://t.co/ERf9gGtniP
@tobhk You'll be carrying that moniker around Uni FOREVER now. *proud*
@tobhk Ha ha ha!! I'm so glad. We should all smile more xx
@tobhk You are very welcome!
@RubbishWife I can go weeks without a flare-up, but sometimes it gets really bad. Feet too :/
@ebookwoman Oooh! I'll try. I've tried all sorts, but it happens whether I'm cold or not.
@goodbrightdog Yes. It really is. It seems such a silly thing but it has me in tears sometimes.
@RubbishWife I really hoped it would ease off :/
@RubbishWife Nope. Raynauds. I'd hoped menopausal central heating furnace would have helped, but no :/
Ow ow ow ow ow https://t.co/v1JJY7tZRD
@koozers @theweeyin15 isn't she just?! Wee dote.
@StiffPigeon @AlanPedigrew You're horrid. Funny. But HORRID.
@AlanPedigrew @StiffPigeon I'm dead clever, me.
@StiffPigeon NOT CLICKING ON ANYTHING YOU SEND ME.
@AlanPedigrew @StiffPigeon I'm reevaluating my friendship with the pigeon. Once I come out of the SHOCK.
@Leontia2001 @uberbobs I've resorted to SHAMING them. And I'm not sorry.
@uberbobs There should be a support group for single parent self-catering holidays out of season by the North Sea with two urchins.
@uberbobs @Leontia2001 Brushing teeth &amp; hair in this house :/
@uberbobs I felt like that 1/2 way through #filey2015! I'm STILL recovering 
@uberbobs Play hide&amp;run.
@AlanPedigrew @StiffPigeon you've made me think about it again :/
@AlanPedigrew @StiffPigeon I was going to have baba ganoush for lunch tomorrow.  Stiff's RUINED my favourite thing.
@StiffPigeon GO. AWAY. FOREVER.
@theweeyin15 It's OK - I'm better now ;) x
@YourMrBumbles @Lamnguin @lardychap *snort*
@Lamnguin @lardychap Fewer complications that way.
@thes2the2 I wasn't crying BTW!!!! That was the baby...
@thes2the2 They are fab :)
@lardychap @Lamnguin All Keith's neighbours are trying to move away...
2 hours of solid crying later... thank goodness I'm in my prime with fossil hunting, fire building boys.
@StiffPigeon *turns back in huffy fashion &amp; pretends to be asleep*
@Lamnguin @lardychap Well hellooo!
@YourMrBumbles @claremackint0sh Gosh.
@StiffPigeon Indeed. But you still have to GO. AWAY. That's going to take a lot of unseeing.
@Lamnguin @lardychap Cad.
Anyway it's not menopausal. It's in my PRRRRIME.
@StiffPigeon @AlanPedigrew Go. Away. And. Never. Come. Back.
@goodbrightdog I enjoy the first one!
If anyone reminds me of the other minor obstacle in my way, they will be *stared hard* at. #baby
I actually wondered there for a second just how far into the menopause I am #baby\n\n*goes to read new mum TLs and gets a grip*
@StiffPigeon @AlanPedigrew That's better than I was expecting tbh
@StiffPigeon @AlanPedigrew What is my prize?
BABY!!!!! Oh my heavens and stars. I've just lost ALL my prickly.
@StiffPigeon @AlanPedigrew You are HORRID. And RUDE.
@lardychap I'm going to use @Lamnguin's sleeve.
@evermoreanon @Lamnguin Pure fuckwittery x
@PricklyEmu @Claire_Phipps You don't even get two guesses for that ;)
@PricklyEmu @Claire_Phipps You don't even get two guesses for that ;)
@evermoreanon @Lamnguin Oh good luck from here too. Although it pains me to have to do this b/c it pains me you are being put through this.
*bristles with testosterone* (also what pish &amp; drivel) https://t.co/3PgElmGZOQ
@lardychap Saturday! https://t.co/b6HBVpk93K
That's me off. You'll find me amidst baby, dogs, bleach, Rachmaninoff &amp; The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. Not all at once.
@lardychap Giselle - with the Royal New Zealand Ballet. Haven't seen it before. Very excited.
@lardychap That's absolutely allowed. They don't leap *that* far.
@TheFlossieTP I'm off on my bicycle! Give York a big squeeze from me x
@AlanPedigrew Awww! That was my Granny's favourite. I keep a bottle of it to remind me of her :)
@lardychap Sometimes. This Saturday afternoon I shall be enjoying the ballet. No snoozing there...
@TheFlossieTP All the stuff is fabulous! Except the snot. But the snot is abating. So it's pretty fabulous. In a non pretty way x
@TheFlossieTP I LOVE you!!! Morning gorgeous one xx
@lardychap We all love a wee nap.
@AlanPedigrew *folds neatly into a twist &amp; hides in the embroidered hanky*
@aslargy @Loudbasket That's because you are LOVELY.
@lardychap I have no problem with men liking football. I just don't want to join in. I'd rather have a little snooze.
@Loudbasket @aslargy Another easier said than done. But practice makes perfect. Blah blah blah... ;)
@AlanPedigrew Mine (not mine mine) was a neurotic cocker spaniel. Drove me bonkers.
@Loudbasket @aslargy I ALWAYS crash. But I'm enjoying the spring while it lasts.
@AlanPedigrew I don't LOOK at them. I just sniff them. I'm turning into *that* aunt-figure.\n\n*sniffs self for Parma violet fustiness*
@nogbad Pffffft. I shall watch it again and do a detailed manipulation analysis. I'm getting back into learnin' mode.
@Loudbasket @aslargy Morning LB! I have a spring in my step. It feels lovely.  I wish you a spring too.
@AlanPedigrew Oh I like other people's. Sometimes (not often) for more than 2 minutes. One client had a dog I didn't like which was odd...
Also 4 dogs. Not in the same house. I like my Friday.
I'm going to cuddle a BABY this morning! One I'll give back after 2 minutes. My favourite kind of baby.
@aslargy @Loudbasket Good morning both! Remember - we are not at home to fuckwittery.
@defsmith Also - you turned a Tory!! I'm very impressed. Also maybe that's the long-term solution for England? A reverse Lysistrata!\n\nMaybe.
@nogbad Now that IS nonsense! She was imagining dripping in diamonds at the opera in Paris &amp; everything! All Alec cared about was his germs.
@nogbad I'm going to have to watch it AGAIN. I saw steely glint in his eyes...
Bed. Night night!
@kernowbeeching @ladytubedriver Me too  - family conspiracy :)
@davidgilray In both our dreams! I'm making a tutu this Christmas.
@kernowbeeching I used to get a sixpence!
@kernowbeeching @ladytubedriver He's 12!! We both know we both know... but it amuses us to keep up the pretence :)
@thatpebbles Yes.
Tried to deliver 1 under the boy's pillow. He saw.\n\nLuckily I had my wits about me: flapped my arms &amp; did a twirl.\n\nTooth fairy lives on.
@thatpebbles it's my favourite in the whole world.
@kernowbeeching Sorry! I'll be quiet now. In fact I'll probably go to bed now!
@SazeAlkin I'm an innocent abroad x
@SazeAlkin I've watched it a million times thinking it was all happenstance. He was lurking &amp; waiting...
@Me_on_Tyne @TheTiniestVole @Lamnguin Def Hughie
@AlexBrightsmith Yep. Ewwwwwww. Still let him have it though.
Alec IS a serial seducer... how did I never see that? #briefencounter
@TheTiniestVole @Lamnguin Yes he should.  Or @Me_on_Tyne.
@AlexBrightsmith I never figured it out. He liked used ones better than new ones though. Which always felt a bit grim...
@TheTiniestVole #boak
@AlexBrightsmith My old cat was obsessed with emery boards too!
@kernowbeeching @BBCRadio4 buy it now!
@kernowbeeching @BBCRadio4 I've had it for ages - lost count of how many times I've seen it! Another good one is Mrs Miniver.
@AlanPedigrew @grumpynorthernc Aziz kills this... https://t.co/Zj4Jt3uYUX
@kernowbeeching @BBCRadio4 Just finished listening to it!
@grumpynorthernc Debenhams! It's an Abigail Aherne design.
@grumpynorthernc Fab isn't it? Couldn't afford it, so glad I got it anyway :)
Happiness is... https://t.co/A0XC07kDpF
@MirandaWhiting @WryHumor Oh that's LOVELY. I'm very glad for you x
@nogbad My heart is all full up.
Thank you @nogbad. This was a real treat. Going into the film now :) https://t.co/hsJeNuBXlX
@MirandaWhiting @WryHumor Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha \n\n*thud*
@ColinTheHuman Oh you lovely man! What a great chum you are. Thank you x
@Loudbasket switch the Internet off &amp; go cuddle up x
@Loudbasket Is J there?
@AlanPedigrew SIGH
@Loudbasket Oh yes. And it's a shitload easier to say than to do xx
@defsmith I don't want anyone else's! I want my own!!!! One day. Not now. Nobody in their right mind should be near me right now.
@AlanPedigrew I do love a tweed jacket though.
@Lamnguin there are many lovely things.
@defsmith Gosh!
@AlanPedigrew It's an ideal world scenario. I'll probably just get another cat. Or a bike.
@Loudbasket Don't let one stupid ruin your day lovely.
@Loudbasket Because they are idiots. Don't give them headspace xx
@StiffPigeon SILLY... ffs.
@StiffPigeon Oh SILKY me!
@Lamnguin I'll book Hanams, then 
@StiffPigeon Jeez. I hope it didn't cost much :/
Right - I've got a date with a cup of tea, some knitting and Brief Encounter. Radio first then the actual film. Because I'm worth it.
@lomelindi12 @BBCTheArchers I'd have put it in 'unfortunate shags best forgotten' section of my Venn diagram. Not touching 'relationships'.
Shall we eat Persian on Saturday @Lamnguin? (Not much green &amp; excellent ice cream). And a nosey round St Giles cathedral?
@StiffPigeon That's no good. It's all about the choons. And the heaving bosoms.
@DJTommyTrouble I'm not a big roast fan - but I do love a roast chicken. And it's as easy as any other tea to make midweek.
@DJTommyTrouble I do that sometimes. I don't generally have the kids at weekends so we do it midweek.
@wombat37 @cherina82 No that's true. I'd not be able to finish it tonight though. \n\nNo booze...
@ebookwoman oh not after 4! I'd never sleep.  Also - kids :/
@cherina82 Mud did the trick! And a shuffle of the holiday play list 
@StiffPigeon 
@wombat37 @cherina82 Oh Wombie... what do I do ALL DAY?! *stares hard*
@Lamnguin @defsmith Careful, Keithy - tread very carefully!
@Lamnguin @defsmith *hates
@Lamnguin @defsmith Ha ha ha ha! Daisy gates that emoji ;)
@cherina82 I could play Tiger Feet while I wash up &amp; then fold laundry...
@cherina82 Still battling virus :/
@cherina82 Oh no that's EVIL.
@defsmith @Lamnguin Awwwww! I've saved it :)
@wombat37 @Lamnguin @defsmith Not for me to say...
@davidgilray Someone just like you! Evening, treasure x
@StiffPigeon Anyway which opera did you see?
@Lamnguin @defsmith Sorry. Can't concentrate. She pulled the  card...
@StiffPigeon I'm also old enough to be his mother :/
@StiffPigeon EXCEPT HIM.
@defsmith @Lamnguin Oh hell now I'm choking.
@defsmith @Lamnguin I just snorted and with my cold it was not pretty at all...\n\nAlso painful.
I'm trying to think of something that will wake me up but won't stop me from sleeping tonight. Any ideas? \n\nNOT GIN. Obvs...
@defsmith @Lamnguin 
@defsmith Except @Lamnguin. He's our pet &amp; darling.
@Jfarrers @defsmith They do. I keep deleting it and then up it pops again.
@defsmith I was being glib apropos my last RT. I'm not actually looking for anyone at all.
Also who thinks Horlicks on Friday night is cool.
I'd like a man who isn't fussed that I'm not fussed about football, likes opera &amp; stuff &amp; dresses like a Tory but isn't one. At all.
That's me screwed then. (Or not). https://t.co/cvxVKjbAAE
@Lamnguin I knows it 
@nogbad Ohhh! I shall listen while I knit rather than iron then, if it's that special.
@Lamnguin I am your VERY best friend though 
@Lamnguin I was teasing. I'm horrid. I'm nearly sorry.
@nogbad OH! All my Christmases have come at once. I'll listen once the kids are out doing their stuff. Thank you.
@PeopleOfUK It's also a term of endearment.  When it's used right :)
@PeopleOfUK besom: a slovenly woman/of dubious character
@craftsBoy ZACKLY! I love my life now it's slower. It's much friendlier &amp; gentler.
@craftsBoy That is a very good thing.
@craftsBoy That's interesting. Why?
@craftsBoy Ha ha ha!!!! We play swapsies in the till queue all the time. Sometimes just for the fun of it. We may need to get out more.
@craftsBoy I would have asked you if you wanted to go in front of us :)
And my abstinence has been noted. There are NO secrets in a small town. None at ALL. \n\nI feel all warm &amp; fuzzy :)
And because it was our @LidlUK, David on the till joined in.  Because he's our chum too.
You know those people who bump into each other at the supermarket till &amp; have a catch up, that you want to kill. That was ME  (+ 2 others).
@marisabirns ha! I'll be collapsed in my bed by 10 again tonight.
@marisabirns Not unless I steal my own! And I haven't made any... finished cleaning work for the day. Off to deliver ironing now.
@DicksterW @TourofBritain Next time you are here come round for a cuppa!
I've set the being proud of me bar LOW.
I've just eaten 2 pieces of flapjack. And the leftover pie from Tuesday. \n\nBut I haven't stolen any biscuits today! 
@RubbishWife EVERY day! #sunalwaysshinesinScotland

@Loudbasket @koozers Luckily I can't actually roll my rrrrrs. In my head I'm ALL the \"now listen to me girrrrrls! I'm in my PRRRRRRIME!\"
@koozers @Loudbasket I'm in accent fear today too. Someone's going to think I'm taking the piss :/
Listening to The Prrrime of Miss Jean Brrodie while I work today. Genuinely afraid of speaking out loud...
@eddsnotdead You've just made my day!
Horlicks rocks. I could NEVER give up Horlicks. https://t.co/rHKQhYrzqV
Kitten not helping... https://t.co/wDPu9nALro
@eddsnotdead Oh. Oh well now the giraffe doesn't seem quite so bad!
@eddsnotdead Noooo. A giraffe would carry a thorny twig. With one inedible drought-resistant leaf attached.
@eddsnotdead I know it takes all sorts but I genuinely don't GET the schmaltzy stuff. It seems like a mask for absence of real feeling.
@VisceralCuties @Loudbasket Oooooh!!!!! I'm very excited. When I worked in a lab all I got to play with was sewage.
@Loudbasket @VisceralCuties I'm already playing with a virus thank you. It doesn't know how to play NICELY.
@thatpebbles You funny bunny!
@VisceralCuties @Loudbasket Is TRUE. When are you taking us to work again? I've got my lab coat ready.
@eddsnotdead I don't want to date a 12yo.
@Lamnguin You don't need the socks dear. Well not the whole pair anyway ;) 
@thatpebbles Not like the can. It's actually very subtle.
@thatpebbles Not the stuff in a can!!
@TheFlossieTP YES!!! It's also oddly liberating blowing with trumpeting abandon. X
@Lamnguin Are you fishing Keith?!!
@thatpebbles Apparently coconut is nice with tea.
@Loudbasket @VisceralCuties I can empathise.
@Loudbasket @VisceralCuties Pleb.
@Lamnguin Sweetheart: if you want to wear your tutu, you go right ahead and wear your tutu. Whichever one you like.
@Loudbasket @VisceralCuties I can see that might have got a wry sideways glance. But an actual guffaw?! Gosh...
@Lamnguin One can go perfectly as oneself. Including jeans x
@TheFlossieTP I would never have known I was capable of manufacturing so much snot. I am AMAZED.
@Loudbasket @VisceralCuties So I see! What were you reading?
@lomelindi12 I love the unsweetened almond. Also hazelnut for a change. Coconut not so good in coffee. Melange - EUCH.
@VisceralCuties @Loudbasket Oh gosh no! I don't have the American Tan tights for that.  I have been carpet shampooing! With a machine.
Oh. Charlie decided to try mixing hazelnut &amp; coconut/almond milk for my coffee. Still: could be worse. Imagine if I'd had a hangover?!
@TheFlossieTP Stuff is just marvellous. Apart from my sinuses which are STILL buggered. How are you?
@VisceralCuties @Loudbasket I have a fragrant kitchen AND sitting room carpet!
Charlie seems to be practising new barista skillz. Not quite sure how he's managing to mangle Nespresso coffee but he's done a good job :/
@TheFlossieTP Morning lovely!
@Loudbasket @VisceralCuties This is a GOOD thing. One day at a time. X
@Loudbasket @VisceralCuties Feeling more splendid by the day LB! How about you?
@Loudbasket @VisceralCuties Morning!
@lomelindi12 Oh OUCH. Poor you!
There are people in the comments who think this is a GOOD thing. I'm obviously not cut out for dating. https://t.co/kw2aKaxw0a
@lomelindi12 @goodbrightdog WONDERFUL
@aslargy I am not a fan at any time. I'm aware I've chosen a daft country to live in holding this view, but...
@aslargy Smother them NOW.\n\nGood morning!
@goodbrightdog @lomelindi12 Here too!
I'm off to bed now. 2 weeks sober &amp; still going strong! Actually got woken up by the alarm this morning. First time in 12 years.
@Lamnguin @defsmith @Me_on_Tyne Mams don't hold coats in this family. Because we are not donkeys or umpires. \n\nMost of the time.
@AlanPedigrew ZACKLY!
@stevecycle1 I used to do that from my job near Eccles - come back via Coldstream but rarely have time now.
@thatpebbles Yep!
@AlanPedigrew It was proper lovely.  Apart from the arsey 4wd school run mum who tried to take me out. Witch.
@thatpebbles Ouch!
@stevecycle1 The worst job is in Stichill: uphill whichever way I go and then 6 bathrooms &amp; beds to do! Great views though &amp; keeps me fit 
@thatpebbles There's some really good new carpet about with anti-stain technology. And getting much cheaper.
@stevecycle1 Lots of different ones. I'm a cleaning lady so I get about. Longest is 6km then another 6km to the next job.
Wednesday morning Cheviots hiding #cycling #scottishborders https://t.co/j3G5PDB229
@thatpebbles I need a new carpet but I reckon this gives me another year to save up. Plus I'll be able to keep new carpet clean too!
@thatpebbles Ha ha! Me neither 
@thatpebbles Mines just less mucky. I'm happy with that :)
@stevecycle1 Snap!
@stevecycle1 It was a cracking afternoon. Had to take my jacket off - end of October!
@stevecycle1 Someone else who cycles to work! And up here! I'm proper made up :)
@thatpebbles Yep - that's where I don't bother trying to decide: too much choice. I go for the good enough approach.
@thatpebbles Yep - that's where I don't bother trying to decide: too much choice. I go for the good enough approach.
@stevecycle1 *waves* Hello!
@thatpebbles I know but it's still all relative. I just go on the reviews &amp; whether I can afford it.
@LyndonMarquis @Loudbasket YES. Sorry for butting in. I'm buggering off again now.
Apologies.  I have a MOIST carpet and I'm not ashamed to admit it.  https://t.co/lPe5M9RMgK
@thatpebbles Vax V-124
@thatpebbles They're a bit like steam mops: the technology is all the same, rest is cosmetic.
@thatpebbles I'll have a look but I don't think it matters. I just chose the one I could afford &amp; mixed the water &amp; detergent for me.
@canuckuk @lardychap Or Aunty  (or 2nd cousin whatever I am)
@thatpebbles At the price, these no point renting the big ones &amp; I found mine to be just as effective.
@canuckuk @lardychap I don't have any of mine :(
@thatpebbles A Vax one - I bought it from Amazon. Less than 1/2 price.
@lardychap @canuckuk My nanna used to make amazing clothes for my doll.
@thatpebbles I've just gone round the big furniture! The machines are very efficient: it's barely damp. Will be dry by morning.
@canuckuk @lardychap I used to love making clothes with my chums. They were dreadful - but it was fun.
@lardychap @canuckuk That would be so cool.
@lardychap @canuckuk I'm going to have lots of fun making clothes for my Barbie. I mean Maddy's Barbie.
@canuckuk @lardychap With flares?
@canuckuk @lardychap That's quite a collection! Colour-coordinated too - ace!
I've just shampood my sitting room carpet. The dirty water bucket is deliciously, satisfyingly DISGUSTING. Feels like I got my  worth 
@canuckuk I do have quite a fondness for white trash Barbie
@canuckuk Snazzy, huh? https://t.co/cLB3KTtrnN
@canuckuk I can't wait for mine to arrive. Or I might just keep Maddie's and she can have the newcomer.
Just bought myself a Barbie. SO I CAN MAKE &amp; FIT CLOTHES FOR MY COUSIN'S DAUGHTER'S BARBIE. \nNot for me AT ALL.
@lardychap Much! And yes - they're fab! I'm intrigued by knitting my own fishnet stockings.

@savouryvinegar @Loudbasket Not happy. I'm HUMMING the bloody thing! Hello :)

@lomelindi12 Yes. A shame but...

@StiffPigeon he'd be SO getting #thelook
@aslargy Yes. The daughter is lovely. And the mother would be too - she's just VERY unhappy. And scared. But I can't let her be my problem.
That's MrsO sacked. Daughter was wonderful. Completely understood. Could we meet for coffee &amp; be friends instead.

@ekctafc @lardychap @TLB73 I actually have rather a thing for chaps in corduroy. And tweed. As long as they're not Tory. It's very tricky.
@lardychap @ekctafc @TLB73 There are four shops in Kelso. Or Boden.
@ekctafc @lardychap @TLB73 It's a uniform! Very funny to see.
@TLB73 @ekctafc @lardychap Welcome up here anytime 
@lardychap @TLB73 @ekctafc Glorious misty autumness here. We see the odd Tory up here in pink corduroys or tweed skirt &amp; think \"oh BLESS\".
@aslargy @Garyw_ JOY.
@TLB73 @ekctafc @lardychap I don't know but I LIKE it.
@ekctafc And a less than tricky day for you too, sweetie! X
@aslargy You'd think, wouldn't you? Made spotlight in the DM headline though. Good morning!
@ekctafc No - just a tricky day :)
@aslargy Don't forget the single mother!
I am feeling clearer and lighter this morning. Thank goodness. Not sure how many yesterdays I could manage.
@ebookwoman This one is on two needles: seam up the back. Easing myself back in gently :)
@theweeyin15 @defsmith Definitely NOT the only one. X
Oh joy - here we go. Again. https://t.co/HatQ3rel5V
@Me_on_Tyne Waders?
@thatpebbles Me too. Night night lovely x
@NiColaCubes @Loudbasket Me or Caligula? 
@Loudbasket Oh! I love the Bob.
@wombat37 @Loudbasket Oh GOSH!
@NiColaCubes @Loudbasket It always makes me feel a better parent.
@ebookwoman @thatpebbles That's a good point. I haven't been this ill for years. Not since I moved here: 6 years!
@Loudbasket @NiColaCubes That always reminds me of the scene in I Claudius with Caligula &amp; his coughing nephew.
@lardychap @wombat37 The wool of the llama!
@nogbad Lions are easy. You just need to tickle their tummies #truefact
@thatpebbles Yes. And knackered beyond belief. Although that might be the virus. Who knows?!
@thatpebbles All over the place. Not wanting a drink but horribly raw.
@nogbad Rabbits are the worst.
@wombat37 Very very fine.
2 weeks since I finished my last bottle of wine. OH! I thought. Where the hell did that go? It was only supposed to be one glass...\n\nAgain.
@nogbad Can't remember. You'd need to watch The Holy Grail to check.
@nogbad Be careful. Llamas can be pretty dangerous.
@wombat37 But not with this wool. I need a different project for this wool. Wrong one - hat would end up fitting a Barbie doll!
@nogbad Tricky
@wombat37 My little red nose will stand out.
@wombat37 All white.
@nogbad not sure... https://t.co/GEXMX8D2Wm
@nogbad I don't do faux anything. You should know this by now!
As I'm rather heavily into sharing at the moment: here is my hat. https://t.co/iIL91Jf3Rr Except mineis winter white. Made of LLAMA.
@goodbrightdog My last thing was a cushion. It took me 3 years. Don't hold your breath!
A hat is happening. Supposed to be writing an essay. Casting on instead.
@NiColaCubes Good luck!
@Loudbasket WE will be. X
@defsmith I love you MOSTEST,  Fluffybum.
@Loudbasket And right back at you xx. I'm either going to emerge from this totally sorted or a complete loon. Could go either way!
@defsmith I love them. Wistful loveliness.
@Loudbasket I'm deep in count the fucks I don't give about almost EVERYTHING right now. No room...
@Loudbasket Ours is actually pretty good. Yours is SPECIAL!
@defsmith I'm only interested in Mud. And the Smoke Fairies tonight.
@defsmith Preparing them for married life ;)
@Loudbasket So much... I keep trying not to proofread the stuff that comes home.
@defsmith I'm learning not to let it bother me. They're learning it makes no difference. It's all good. Really...
I am knackered. Head splitting. \n\nBoys are washing up. Yay! \n\nBoys are doing martyred bickering. Not so Yay!
@thatpebbles Me too.
@thatpebbles It would be! We'll find out one day :)
@Loudbasket He's probably used Publisher. I cringe at what my kids are being taught (I'm a trained typesetter).
@Loudbasket So many shades of wrong in there.
@Loudbasket oh dear
@thatpebbles There's always an exception.  Or three :)
@thatpebbles &gt; the Gare Du Nord and 'recognised' them immediately. Happened a lot!
@thatpebbles I used to be quite good at it on the phone when I was working in the old days. Arranged to meet someone I'd never seen in &gt;
@thatpebbles Ha ha ha ha!!!
@thatpebbles No. None at all. I'm growing to accept mine. It gets me places pretty well &amp; that does for me :)
@thatpebbles I've a small frame (I'm quite short) but long legs &amp; skinny wrists &amp; ankles. Huge child-bearing hips though ;)
@AlanPedigrew @grumpynorthernc @danbloom1 Yep. And from the Indyref position either. Not because she was no, but her attitude.
@thatpebbles Losing the car. And not drinking as much  as before kids. Before kids I drank at least a bottle of wine a day.
@AlanPedigrew @grumpynorthernc @danbloom1 I hate her. I don't do hate particularly but I bloody hate her.
@thatpebbles Hah! I've spent most of my adult life 3 dress sizes bigger than I am now.
@defsmith @theweeyin15 I was so rubbish at it. Spent 3 years in floods of tears x
@thatpebbles It will come to me x
@thatpebbles SIGH. When I'm 90 I'm going to live on bramble &amp; apple pie.
This is my bucket list. Nothing else. Just this.  https://t.co/amabj6WF9f
@thatpebbles Ah no - I rarely make pudding pies. I should really. But then I'd have to run a whole lot more.
@thatpebbles Chicken, leek &amp; sweetcorn in a cream sauce
Why I take the photo of the pie before it's baked... https://t.co/Dhk4cbyeWg
@theweeyin15 yes... I know xx
@theweeyin15 Oh pet xx
Looks like a good tie in to the Sapiens book @Lamnguin  https://t.co/LZQyTLXcVH
@wombat37 @NiColaCubes FABULOUS!
@squadrat NO
@TheBoyCoombes @nogbad No rush - it'll be worth waiting for!
Autumn selfie pie (with Betty of course) https://t.co/CBhkd9CRGB
@nogbad Never mind...
@Lamnguin I've screenshotted it already. You knows it.
@Lamnguin I'm framing that tweet 
@nogbad There's got to be a Mud version of Godwin's Law...
@nogbad What about Mud?
@nogbad Ohhhh...
@Lamnguin Laaarnden akshwally
@nogbad I do not know where Ardwick is...
@thes2the2 Just because I can.
@ekctafc Have a hot water bottle ready for the tummy ache.
#asktwitter  https://t.co/EthhdNOcsH
I've just blown my youngest's mind. Not only have I BOUGHT a selection box of biscuits,  I've told him he can have as many as he likes.
@Lamnguin And That Fancy London Town...
@MsAlliance Crappy client. Shell be dead  before me &amp; I'm not going back. All is well x
@Tsaksonakis I BLOODY LOVE YOU!
@ebookwoman I might. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now tbh. Not you: just the whole huge THING of it.
And venture OUT and buy some wool. To knit a bobble hat.
I can either sit &amp; carry on crying &amp; feeling sorry for myself OR...\nI can go &amp; put a frock &amp; some kick-ass boots &amp; red lipstick on.
@eddsnotdead @wombat37 @defsmith Can we whack MrsO, too?
@defsmith @eddsnotdead @wombat37 NO. Even though I've never watched Star Trek.
Fucking hell - she's just tried to give me an extra pound coin. When I refused \"there's just no helping you\"
@aslargy She's asleep. I'm going to sneak off and then that's it done.
@eddsnotdead @defsmith @wombat37 I like that idea lots!
@aslargy No. Self-respect innit.
@aslargy I don't think I'll be coming back.
@eddsnotdead @defsmith @wombat37 Is it a problem that I don't know what the deathstar looks like?
I've had better days...
@aslargy There's going to be a call to her daughter this evening. Which will take 1/2 an hour... again.  I don't get paid for these calls :/
@eddsnotdead @defsmith @wombat37 I see you Red 5! Are we ready? Shall we go and slay the Blues?
\"Been behaving Dorothy?\"\nYes Mrs\n\"God you must have a boring life\"\n\nBeing old isn't an excuse...
@thatpebbles Euch :( sorry!
@eddsnotdead @defsmith @wombat37 Afternoon :)
@Ellililalou It was SUPER, thank you!
@ebookwoman Which programme? I'm out of WiFi at the moment. I'll have to get it on catchup. There's not much left for me to give up!
MrsO last week: don't touch that corner!\nMrsO this week: you didn't clean that corner last week. It's not good enough...
Work calls. Along with the cold which just won't go :/ Ta ra!
@nogbad oh we didn't stay for tea.
@nogbad Larks upon larks!
Fancy that! https://t.co/b5hzUjds25
@Lamnguin I remembered yesterday I've seen much more culture than I admitted to the other day. Crazy times.
@defsmith @wombat37 @eddsnotdead Quite. I never dare rely on absence of anything to denote consent or otherwise ;)
@nogbad I am also a Kerr! And my son has shot the present Marquis in the bottom with a nerf bullet. How we all laughed!
@nogbad He does! And @CalumKerrSNP is a FABULOUS MP. He's doing us proud.
@Lamnguin Euch. Morning lovely.  And then the culture!
@nogbad I'm sure she'll be all for it. I'll speak to my MP first. He's very approachable.
@nogbad Yes. And maybe MPs. Especially government ministers.
@nogbad Well yes - I'm thinking of those appointed to.
Mandatory drug testing for people responsible for our well-being and safety would be a good idea, no?
@EscapedHere Nespresso machine is fired up...
@thes2the2 No not yet. If he got tea wrong he'd have to find somewhere else to live, and I daren't take that risk.
@EscapedHere Good morning!
As well as looking furious, he also looks as though he's had 'a bit of a late night'. https://t.co/Mp9zDFIiVj
@Ellililalou Adorable! Good morning x
@aslargy He's a treasure!
@aslargy He went with the untyped option 'coconut &amp; almond'. Overpowering unfortunately. Still we've learned.\n\nGood morning!
@wombat37 I read it as amusing x
@wombat37 Deep, Wombie, deep!
'Do you want hazelnut, almond or BORING ORDINARY milk, mum? Frothy or straight?\"\n\nOne 10yo available for very short-term hire.
@wombat37 Oh struggling on! Getting there, lovely.  Definitely getting there x
On the plane at our expense...  https://t.co/hvfRsJRDja
@yokelbear I'm rather enjoying it. Petulant arses. I've got my mum 'sulk all you like but it won't change anything' face on.
@Loudbasket You do, lovely xx
@wombat37 He's just woken up! He'll be on it once he's fed his kitten.
@yokelbear I hope so. I hope they've got a lot more to come.
@wombat37 @eddsnotdead @defsmith Oh you star! You must have read my mind while I was typing my last tweet!
Waiting for my little barista to wake up... this unexpected treat of motherhood isn't EVER going to get old.
@wombat37 @eddsnotdead @defsmith Good morning AND...\nHappy Boxing Day Birthday!
@wombat37 @eddsnotdead @defsmith Good morning AND...\nHappy Boxing Day Birthday!
@Loudbasket I think the big thing yesterday was feeling my nemesis abandonment. The whole thing is throwing up some scary shit.
@wombat37 @eddsnotdead @defsmith Yes it's a good one if everyone knows the rules &amp; conforms. I usually stick a polite note on the door.
@eddsnotdead @defsmith I'm a bit in awe here. I just sit quivering thinking 'please not here, please don't'.
@Loudbasket Thank you. And I know .  Bit of a rough day - it passed &amp; I made it through. Hurrah! Xx
@ebookwoman @thatpebbles Exactly.
@thatpebbles @ebookwoman Yep. Right lovelies - got to go. Job #4.
@thatpebbles @ebookwoman I don't see why it can't be. For me.
@ebookwoman JOY.
@ebookwoman @thatpebbles Hence blanket NO.
@ebookwoman @thatpebbles It's odd.  I have 0 desire to drink daily. 0 desire to get pissed. Problem is zero control once I've had 1 drink.
@ebookwoman That is just the PERFECT metaphor x
@thatpebbles I haven't got that far.
@ebookwoman @thatpebbles I HATE them.
@ebookwoman Don't we all!
@eddsnotdead Snap. We don't play.
@thatpebbles I've found it. \"No\".
@ebookwoman @thatpebbles I think the problem is I don't do platitudes &amp; that seems to be what I'm being given most.
@ebookwoman It's incredibly well researched. I loved it: need to read it again to pluck out the bits I need.
@Loudbasket A bit meh &amp; adrift tbh. Nice chap but neither of us know where I can go with this. Other than the obvious 'just say no'.
@thatpebbles Oh he has. He's just never met me. Has no idea that I am fit.
Today I was given the helpful advice to maybe try &amp; get fit as a way of avoiding alcohol. It was meant well &amp; said kindly, BUT...
@ebookwoman I'm so incredibly lucky.
\"@qikipedia: Ancient Egyptians believed that the only real function of the brain was to pass snot to the nose\" Is TRUE.
@aGirlcalledBoys @Loudbasket @hughkeogh My cold would have disappeared in a day if I'd had an object of such beauty to keep my tissues in.
@Ca_Metzger @ebookwoman Yep.
@Ca_Metzger @ebookwoman Seems not any more.
@Loudbasket Gah.
Afternoon ride home #cycling #scottishborders https://t.co/430sCXNyUA
@Loudbasket How can sugar be out of date?
@ebookwoman maybe something to do with it being effectively privatised?
@nogbad This is why I have no fondness for MrF. I'd like to as he helped make my boys, but...
@nogbad We are agreed.
@nogbad On my to-do list.
@nogbad Best can be done is a stern letter from solicitor (which I pay for). \"I say MrF - it would be good if you could pay something.\"
@nogbad Ha ha ha ha ha!\n\nThey haven't been taking on any new cases for ages.
@EscapedHere Ha!
@AlanPedigrew We hate him more :)
Here's a thought: maybe IDS could do something to make absent fathers contribute something towards their kids' upkeep?
Job #3. No lunch break. IDS can do one as well...
Off to catch up with #thearchers. Back to my happy place.
@AlanPedigrew I might have another go in a minute.
Keep a pet bot unblocked to swear at instead of actual people #twoptip
@CMBeee @MsAlliance @scaryduck Cheers.
@scaryduck YES xx
@MsAlliance @scaryduck Also in the same town as my ex. Not ideal.
@MsAlliance @scaryduck There's one closer. I can get to it but can't get home. Public transport :/
@MsAlliance @scaryduck Yep.
@scaryduck @MsAlliance Also mansplaining \"are you SURE there isn't a meeting in Kelso? I'm sure if you looked harder.\"
@scaryduck @MsAlliance Not every week. And not the time.
@scaryduck @MsAlliance Yes. And I get told I'm not trying hard enough. I've got to REALLY want it. I wanted to scream.
@scaryduck @MsAlliance Yes. I'm still full of stuff. And scared &amp; self-loathing &amp; god knows what shit.
@scaryduck @MsAlliance 9 hours A - 9 hours for one 90 minute meeting. And 30 to get there. I don't have the time or the money.
Swearing at a bot. A whole new Twitter low. Cathartic though.
@giveawayvia Fuck off.
@scaryduck @MsAlliance Tbh I'm finding the phone thing really hard. I know it's supposed to be helpful BUT :/
@MsAlliance I'm SPECIAL. The only alcoholic in my little town ;)
@scaryduck I remember! I did think of you when I went. And thank you x
@MsAlliance But I KNOW I can't drink again. So that's cool :)
@MsAlliance it was the right thing to do &amp; the right time to do it. But the logistics of getting to meetings aren't feasible.
@millieweb Thank you poppet x
@nogbad Rookie mistake of one who hasn't had the joy. SHE would have oooodles to talk about ;)
@nogbad I DARE you!!! I'm sure I could find her number somewhere...
@nogbad *snort*. I have absolutely NO idea! She's more likely to talk to you this side of eternity.
@nogbad I've got my vest on.
MrsM is still busy reading her Daily Express. Pretending not to watch the funeral party leaving next door's.
@nogbad Started yesterday.
@nogbad fabulous! Saved it this time. Thank you x
@defsmith Ha ha ha ha *yawn* 
@thatpebbles We do half term better in Scotland too!! ;)
Charlie's going to leave for school at approximately 12 past 8. \n\nThis is my life..
@nogbad Thanks lovely
@nogbad PFFFFT 
@nogbad Later today when you've got time could you remind me of the exhibition in Edinburgh in November, please?
@nogbad I'm still pfffting cute food ;)
@nogbad I do draw horrified faces on boiled eggs - does that count?
@nogbad Nope! I'm a hard mother.
@lardychap Yeah. Exactly. And I will.
@nogbad Even as babies I never pissed about with food. They ate or went hungry until the next meal.
@nogbad No apology necessary! You weren't the first to send me that link ;)
@nogbad Oh hell no. The day I make a cute face out of food to persuade my kids to eat is the day I go back on the gin.
@lardychap It was the right thing to do but not sustainable. Took 9 hours to attend a 90 minute meeting. Plus . Don't have either to spare
@nogbad Good morning! And thank you. Very cute. I don't do cute. I do wholesome ;)
@theweeyin15 Me too! Right I'd better leap - stupid squeeze all the jobs in day today. Have a good one lovely x
@theweeyin15 Aim HIGH!
@TLB73 Yesterday was the right thing to do but hard &amp; disappointing. Feeling much better today :)
@theweeyin15 A MILLION times better. Physically &amp; mentally x
@theweeyin15 SOON you too will be asked 'do you want hazelnut milk or ordinary in your coffee, mum'. Hold on: it's worth it xx
I can breathe! Through my nose! HAPPY days. (I'm ignoring the 7 hours solid scrubbing ahead)
@TLB73 Good morning Tim x
@theweeyin15 Oh euch :(
Happy happy happy birthday @wombat37! Have a FABULOUS day xx
Oh heck. Ironing coming in tomorrow. Better get my own done. That's me over &amp; out for the night. Ta ra chums &amp; thanks for the hand holding x
@smuffie YES X
@EscapedHere Hopefully tomorrow. Today I'm just spent. Never felt quite like this before. Hopefully it's the start of rebuilding x
@goodbrightdog @ebookwoman @thatpebbles UGH. Now that's revolting talk 
@goodbrightdog @ebookwoman @thatpebbles 
@goodbrightdog @ebookwoman @thatpebbles I'm sorry. I really am. I'm going to go and do ALL the jobs I should have done today.
@kernowbeeching Yes x
@ebookwoman @thatpebbles @goodbrightdog I've got a couple of quinoa &amp; butterbean burgers left 
@ebookwoman @thatpebbles @goodbrightdog Oh lord now I'm remembering the eyelashes :/
@kernowbeeching Maybe tomorrow. Just exhausted today. Can't remember ever feeling so tired :(
*wails* https://t.co/7lvFOyRwhs
@MonaHelluvaLott @fewerror *snort*
A comrade-in-arms for you @Lamnguin  https://t.co/NTvw1ZIWuB
@goodbrightdog @thatpebbles @ebookwoman Jeez she's bad.
@smuffie I'm scrubbing 9 loos tomorrow. I'd do 10x that rather than go back x
@goodbrightdog @thatpebbles @ebookwoman Raunchy.
@goodbrightdog @thatpebbles @ebookwoman I've just imploded into a heap on my kitchen floor
@smuffie Worth it
@goodbrightdog @ebookwoman @thatpebbles I'll get my coat.
@ebookwoman @thatpebbles @goodbrightdog I'm not sure which was worse - the shaving, the ear wax or the teeth :/
@goodbrightdog @thatpebbles I did it to impress my mother in law. People pleasing to the MAX!
@EscapedHere Yes. Going today confirmed that I can't drink again. I know I can't do moderation: been trying that for 30 years!
@thatpebbles @goodbrightdog I made brawn a couple of times. Beyond grim - but yummy.
@kernowbeeching It was a bit of a mixed bag. The right thing to do but I feel pretty wrung out.
@meatloaf1333 Tired but fine thanks x
@EscapedHere Apparently. The people I've spoken to on the phone didn't mention it, but someone at the meeting did.
On the bus now. All the cars have headlights switched on :/
@theweeyin15 yes. Yes you are xx
@defsmith I have a Samsung too. We can change our battery when it's flat.
@matsyendrasana Yes. I know.
@defsmith I'm feeling a little emoticon deprived tbh. The iPhone people are ahead of the game.
@defsmith *strokes hair*
@defsmith I won't use it in my love letters to you then.
@defsmith Which one?!
@matsyendrasana I live in a remote area without a car. It can be quite limiting.
@matsyendrasana I think you've misunderstood me. The meeting &amp; people were lovely but I can't spend 10 hours getting to a 90 minute meeting.
@marisabirns *cuddles up with tea*
And now I've got a blistering headache because PEOPLE. Nice people, but still people. I'll be in hiding for the next decade.
Well everyone was very lovely. I'm not sure it's the right support network for me (logistics). I think I'll probably stick with you lot.
Right then Twitter - we are doing this. Meet you for a coffee on the other side x
@nogbad As long as you sulk quietly...
@Loudbasket @MonaHelluvaLott @smuffie You might need to remind me. When the time comes...
John Lewis loos\nOverheard \"mummy is that lady doing a huge FART?!!!!!\"\nMe \"No, this lady is blowing her nose\"\nOverheard \"Olivia, SHUSH!\"
@nogbad You're not sharing my cheese scone though ;)
@thatpebbles Ooh which one?
I'll have time to pop into John Lewis first. John Lewis makes EVERYTHING better.
@ladytubedriver Sorry - couldn't resist ;)
@ladytubedriver But don't you just sit there &amp; press a button?! 
@ladytubedriver In my head you're driving this train x
@MonaHelluvaLott @Loudbasket @smuffie Boy children were wasted on me ;)
I'm on the train now btw #notbottledit
@porridgebrain Shall we just get notevermarried now? Xx
@Loudbasket @DicksterW @wombat37 No. No I'm not ;)
@MonaHelluvaLott @Loudbasket @smuffie My dog is called Betty. My next dog is already named Gladys. Or maybe Janet.
@porridgebrain Today my list would be: pockets; wellies; notebook with pen; Tiger Feet; hat (pref bobble); ironed white cotton bedlinen.
@smuffie @Loudbasket My big boy cat is called Colin.
@porridgebrain When I dipped my toe into online dating, 'pockets' was one of the 6 things I couldn't live without :)
@TheFlossieTP @nyncompoop I'm SO sorry x
@MsAlliance Suddenly my day got a WHOLE lot easier ;) xx
@squadrat Oh I'm very glad I found out first ;) xx
@TheFlossieTP Love you xx
@porridgebrain yes - you are... xx https://t.co/hLsq0tCMWV
I'm going to switch my phone off now because it's all a bit much. And teary was never my best look...
Hence the oversharing: I need you lot. Thank you x 2/2
The only meeting I can get to &amp; back from is in Edinburgh. I leave the house at 8:30 &amp; return at 6. It's not feasible every week. 1/2
@MsAlliance you didn't miss anything, treasure. That was my coming out tweet. And thank you xx
@peasbloss that's my usual! Had it with peashoots &amp; a left over burger from last night :)
@AlanPedigrew From my very limited exchanges with her I think the advantages far exceed moderation in meat &amp; potato pie consumption 
@JustJimWillDo @RepresentPledge @BBCWorld Lysistrata! Nothing much changes...
I'm going to my first AA meeting today. I've written about 5,376,254 scenarios in my head. 2 of them good. Even without drink I'm an idiot.
@writinggoaway Oh no - thank YOU!
@writinggoaway Betty has just got up too!
@AlanPedigrew It's nice to keep it special though. I have one pork pie in Filey. (Which I shared - wish I hadn't).
@AlanPedigrew OOOOF. Worth it.
@writinggoaway DEAL!
The Happy Pear burgers make good breakfast too! https://t.co/sZ4YbXL6wS
@uberbobs @barnsleysime YOU are a GOOD man Bobsy.
@AlanPedigrew TSK. No. For being all the healthy. On which note - did I see you are filling up with pies this weekend?
@writinggoaway I have the coffee!
@uberbobs @barnsleysime You are supposed to be asleep
@GardenNicola Drunk in the nightmare. Not irl!
@GardenNicola My sleep is improving. Still waking but better quality when I am asleep. Apart from the nightmare last night: got drunk :/
@ClareMBrown1 Morning gorgeous!! Xx
Not drinking isn't making me any cleverer...
I saved half an avocado last night for something interesting for breakfast this morning but I can't remember what 
@barnsleysime @uberbobs  squeak
@barnsleysime @uberbobs He was PLAYING with me - like a big mean pussycat with a wee timid defenseless mouse.
@davidtims @uberbobs It's not my fault! It was trained this way. For my CAREER. Not this one obvs ;)
@uberbobs @davidtims No I'm #WHOLESOME! How many times to I have to say?! 
@uberbobs @davidtims Gosh I hope that wasn't a rude emoticon. I didn't mean it like THAT.
@uberbobs @davidtims There.  Now I love you both. Isn't that cosy?! 
@uberbobs I dreamt I had a drink* last night. It wasn't good.\n\n*many
@uberbobs @davidtims I just wanted to know the actual time everyone else thought it was.
@uberbobs @davidtims But I've got no analogue clock in my bedroom to compare! You didn't know that of course - to be fair.
@uberbobs Oh. You can be my friend too. Again. I've got a headache Bobsy. How bloody unfair is that?
@uberbobs You are not helpful. I've gone off you. @davidtims is helpful. HE is my friend today 
@davidtims Yay! Thank you x
@uberbobs Where's mine Bobsy? WHAT TIME IS IT? Please.
@davidtims The kitchen clock will know! That's still on real time...
@davidtims oh. Is the speaking clock still a thing? I don't trust the phone... Good morning!
Is it 6:15 &amp; I've got time time to enjoy the morning or is it 7:15 &amp; I've got to leap out of bed muttering expletives?
@nogbad should be!

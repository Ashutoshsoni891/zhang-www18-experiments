@RebeccaFiona Your lyrics are so beautiful. I love all of the previews of Beauty Is Pain I heard on iTunes.

I'm done with this, done with that, and done with you.
Spoken like a true narcissist.

Your fedora needs to be thrown into the fires of hell, never to be spoken of again.
You kind of had bad breath when I was kissing you. I didn't tell you that though because I am SUCH a good person! *in my Gretchen voice*
I should go to sleep, but I don't want to...
I'm just a little Human.
If @britneyspears and Beyonce did a song together I think I would die.

I miss your goofy smile.
I'm an open book at this point.

If I said I want your body... Would you hold it against me?...
@Paris__Marie I hope all at once! I'll binge watch that shit!
@Paris__Marie I know the first season came out all at once, but I'm not sure what Netflix is going to do for the second one.
I'm a #Stan for @britneyspears and PROUD of it!
Orange Is The New Black - Season 2 - Teaser - Netflix [HD]: http://t.co/AlfyDVyhlB via @Paris__Marie  !!!!!!!
Had a good V-Day with one of my best friends! :)
Some people have real problems.
I wonder what it's like to have a REAL relationship. I'm almost 22, when is it going to happen for me?
This customer was flirting with me at work today, but he was ugly, of course...
Sailing away.
Time goes by so slowly,
How hard is it to pick up a phone?

The Help is one of my favorite movies. \" You is kind. You is smart. You is important. \"
I am on YOUR Team,
You know you truly love someone when you hurt when they hurt...
This dream isn't feeling sweet, we're reeling through the midnight streets And I've never felt more alone, feels so scary getting old.
I think about you all the time, just so you know. Like, all the time. Probably isn't very healthy for me, but I can't help it...
This flappy Bird game is impossible. Like is you serious muddafucka?
I wish you were alone with me.
I'd change my name to Anastasia Beaverhausen, but Twitter doesn't like people with long names. WHAT IF THAT WAS MY REAL NAME. #ThanksObama
If you think/thought being a teenager was hard, just wait until you're in your 20's and you have no idea what you're doing with your life.
Airycka.
I just took my temperature and it's 100.2. I knew I was feeling like shit today. I hope this doesn't get worse -_-.
My eyes are getting heavy.
I'm so glad I love the people I work with :).
It must be nice not having a job or real life responsibilities. I wouldn't know. I've had a full time job since I was 18.
I love Kayla Morgan so much.
I still love this picture of us.
You can leave like the sane abandoned me.
I'm glad I'm making a connection with my dad again :D.
I got a free beer from this waiter.. Idk why. Did he think I'm cute or something? o.o
I guess I'm not going to the AA meeting like we planned. Thanks.
Going to my first AA Meeting tomorrow, a little nervous.
Anastasia Beaverhausen.
@MattKansas What do you prefer?
@MattKansas I'd retweet this, but I don't want to have it on my timeline lol.
I don't blame it though...
My stomach hates me.

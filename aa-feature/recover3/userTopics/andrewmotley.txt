Happy Birthday to one of my best buds @BrettW_2011 hope you have a good one buddy!
@jakecovillee it's crazy as hell bud!
@MWillingham09 bouncer to 3rd and the 3rd baseman drops it and picks it up throws a one hopper to the catcher and the catcher misses it 
Crappy way to lose a ball game
Ball was a little low but he should've smashed the other 2 before that anyways.
Great weekend with my girlfriend now ready to get this work week over with already and it hasn't even started yet.
@chancebright sucks worse playing this late and not winning 
Love playing softball but hate playing until 3 in the morning

Ready for some Auburn football!
Today is gonna be a good day! 
@skashh happy birthday!
I'm pulling for the Warriors simply because I can't stand LeBron James.
Nothing pisses me off more than getting ketchup on my khaki shorts. 
She's got every single thing\nThat makes up my wildest dreams 
Ready to spend all day with my gal as soon as I get off work tomorrow 
Today is flying by 
Birthday month 
@skashh 
@skashh 
I couldn't ask for a better girlfriend 
Had a wonderful lazy date night with Jordyn tonight 
Let's head to Tuscaloosa to give them all my money and get off this shitty probation.
Makes me sick to my stomach having to pay all this money tomorrow.
Tomorrow will be a great day! No more probation  #ftpd
Had a great day with my sweetheart 
Jordyn has me hooked watching Criminal Minds now
Forgot I had to wake up at 5:30 for work in the morning until just now 
I've had such a great weekend. I don't think I've been this happy in a very long time!
Ufc all night 
@MWillingham09 eat  
@BzNelson10 @OhIsaac fuck 2 chainz that wobbling jackass 
@OhIsaac terrible. Threw me out of the tourny pretty much. I won't play if he is umpiring again.
@OhIsaac as long as Congo is an umpire I'm not playing lol
Anyways I'm blessed with the perfect girl to always put me in a better mood  couldn't be more thankful!
Won't be playing softball for a while after tonight.
I've been in a great mood all week! 
Just got all hot and sweaty jamming out and singing along to Colt 45 on the way to this delivery 
Falling for this girl day after day 
Good time hanging with Nick tonight and caching up on everything. Missed my bud! 
@sobermeech shiiiiit!
Can not wait for Sunday 
Not doing the sled for a while after tonight. Don't enjoy puking my guts up after!
Haven't been able to hold a conversation with someone like this in a very long time. I'm definitely enjoying it!
Work time 
@stefanh416 swole ass
Best pump I've had in a while  http://t.co/Oft8027wZA
I get so irritated when any kind of pet hair gets on me.
If I could make a living out of loving you, I'd be millionaire in a week or two. 
@alysonmotleyy if you ate all the watermelon I swear I will throat punch you.
 https://t.co/ugDQ6PaztF
@OHellItsRail I'm here for an hour every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.
Everyone is trying to get me to go try out the new Wilmores gym but I can't get myself to leave Powerhouse.
@OHellItsRail damn I go to the AA on Baltimore Ave and they only give you one but it's a bunch of cool ass people
@OHellItsRail where you go to AA at?
We are all just living to die.
Dodged a fucking bullet!
That's fucked up.
@Winkles84 just get some meth works about the same lol
@Winkles84 http://t.co/ltEbVR1kxf
Traffic is horrible.
Half day of work

http://t.co/8JQzsk6iAn
@_jordanrowell love ya buddy!
Everyone have the Rowell family in your prayers. Lost a loved one tonight.  
Sling Blade to end my night 

Let's wake up at 5:30 and go to work  that's all I am looking forward to. 
Come on.
5:30 is going to come way too early in the morning 

@OHellItsRail tru! I remember the time went all went and chowed down!
@OHellItsRail chicken biscuits in the mornings 
Praying for a good day! 
I love Winkles snapchat stories 
Got to find me a inside job  too damn hot outside.
Work is gonna kick my ass today.

Thank God I made it home 
Which way should I go home from the fields is the question....?
@OhIsaac let me ask
It's bad when all I look forward to is playing softball on Friday nights every week 
@GDavvg you work at Weathers you don't have a summer.
Preworkout has me geeking right now.
Wonderful day so far hopefully it will only get better 
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century could I count on you to be there to support me mentally? 
I reckon I'll head to work now.

@Dano_8  we can take some walks to the car and throw a few back!
@Dano_8 better see you up at the fields this weekend buddy!
Gym time 
Wish these next 2 months would fly by so I can be chillaxing on the beach for a week.
I would do some crazy things to be rich and not have to work another day in my life. #gottopaythebillstho
So much energy this morning.
Time to hit the weights
Bored
TMT 
48-0
Floyd so cocky! That's why I like em!
@benson_clay 12 and Mayweather!
@benson_clay yeah buddy!
Mayweather has this.
#MayweatherWins
About to buy this fight just so I don't have to get out the house
Powerhouse is my second home.
I don't know what to do with myself on Friday's when we don't play softball 
Nervous about this fight tomorrow. #MayweatherWins
Love moments like these  http://t.co/F8aRzUxk2w
Mayweather isn't losing this fight.
Ready for the nap I'm going to take when I get off work today
My back is dead from deadlifting 
Tell me are we ever gonna stop playing these games 
Working today with 1 hour of sleep last night has me feeling some type of way.
Ready for 5:30 so I can get off work and come home and go straight to sleep. Softball on Fridays when I have to work Saturdays are horrible.
@stefanh416 I ain't going back!
@stefanh416 
Get off probation a month early 
So many beautiful girls in Tuscaloosa 

I've already got a good bit of money on you buddy so please don't let me down. @FloydMayweather
@FetuccineCapone thanks bud! Just 2 more months! 
This drive to Tuscaloosa in the morning by myself will be the death of me.
Throwing around some weights will always put me in a better mood no matter what.
@stefanh416 we got to talk mom into ordering the fight 
Who are y'all putting your money on? Mayweather or Pacquiao?
I found 98 people do not follow me back via http://t.co/Mv40iLR9kD
Privacy is on the door but still they can hear you screaming more 
Nelly pandora station is the best.
Only good thing about getting up and going to work at 5:30 every Wednesday is I get off at 12 
It's not about the size of your rod, it's about how you use your tackle baby 
Ain't got no time to waste no time.
Got a new PR on bench tonight 
Ready for this Mayweather fight!
The King!
My shirt ain't got no strips but I can make that..
Just lost my damn shoes at the golf course chasing a damn duck.
I just wasn't made for golf 
Ready for Cody and Kayleigh's wedding!
I can't gain weight to save my life.

My new protein taste like 
Wayne gonna pop off on young thug just watch
Got to work on myself before I can let anyone else in my life!
AA is packed tonight!
How bout them Braves?!
@Bro_mar12 
I eat Zaxbys about 4 times a week. 
@MWillingham09 hell me either lol I play with jimmy Cy now
@MWillingham09 when you going to come out of retirement?
Believe I will head to Auburn Saturday and watch the spring game!
Blessed to see another day 
A tramp, a gentleman, a poet, a dreamer, a lonely fellow, always hopeful of romance and adventure.
Blow is on 
It seems Ive spent too long only thinking about myself. But now I want to spend my life just caring about somebody else.
Cardio isn't for me
Time to go get my Sunday swole on. #houseofpower
Braves 
@Dano_8 damn bud maybe next time!
@Dano_8 yall win it?
Softball is killing me on Friday nights
Confused - Gucci 
Ready to meet my niece on my lunch break today! Sucks I have to work and miss it this morning!
Ymart chicken biscuits are amazing
@BaileyB_1  I just need to stick to my diet but Zaxbys and ichi is holding me back 
And that's probably why I can't get abs 
Ichi express never disappoints me
Debating on going to the Braves game Saturday or not..
Braves!!
Chop chop!!
@bstrace I appreciate it
@brittanybrown3 thank you! Love you also!
@GriffinWade thanks buddy! I had no clue I wasn't following you  but means a lot!
@T_Blevins thanks my man means a lot!
First step is admitting it.

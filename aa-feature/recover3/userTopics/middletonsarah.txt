Miami traffic and family power-struggles put me on edge. #nerves
My thoughts are with the Bowers' family right now.
The car rental guy is trying to upgrade mom. Mom isn't taking his shit. \"Let me see the small car first and I'LL tell you if it's too small\"

I'm a tea-drinking fool. #PeppermintTea #SplashofLemon
I played with a puppy named Charlie tonight. Ah, such a good time was had!

My big fat Utz wedding. Tonight is going to be awesome! #timetoparty @mutz004 @jutz14 @KDandron @middletonemily
Michigan is freezing. Idk why I expected anything different.
Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.
The third time in 3 classes my professor has mentioned his white cat named Desdemona. I'm thinking he's a very lonely guy.
I only have two classes this semester and they still can't be over fast enough. #hurryup5oclock

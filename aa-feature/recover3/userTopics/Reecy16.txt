I'd prefer it if you didn't lump me together in the same category with all your other exes. Awesome. Thanks. Moving on.
You're so hott, I wanna get u alone, I wanna get you stoned. I don't want to be your friend, I want to fuck you like ill never see you again
Shout out to my best friend who puts up with all my bullshit. She'struly amazing and pretty damn cool @shy_gibbs
Only I would order a medium specialty pizza from my work for delivery and eat the whole damn thing. #stonerproblems
Sometimes I think having a friend with benefits would be a wonderful thing.
@JarrettBristow hey text me 6412606182
@shy_gibbs Thank ya sas.
Ready in the AM http://t.co/bTnKPjEJJu
The fact that I try not to say I actually hate a person but I can say it about you. Probably means you're a whore-able person.
My past 50+ hrs consisted of, 4hrs of sleep, a serious allergic reaction, 2 breakdowns and going on 10days of straight work. Fuck this week.
Not all those who wonder are lost.
@_jennafurious Lmao. Fantastic.
Merry Christmas..
You don't know me. So don't talk about me or my past like you do. You're fucking in the wrong persons business.
@shy_gibbs what car bitch?!
@shy_gibbs don't tell me how to live my life!!
@shy_gibbs am I really supposed to get ready?
@shy_gibbs finding pants right now.
@shy_gibbs well considering I'm sitting on my couch... I'd say I already am.
@Reecy16 I can see that. I'd like to say you've done a hell of a job. Keep up the good work.
@shy_gibbs Lmao you're such a sassy pants.

@shy_gibbs I'm not having a pity party. Its a song.
I hate this town, it's so washed up. And all my friends don't give a fuck.
\"@FriendlyAssh0le: Lol my life story http://t.co/3B2Shm5KhE\" @shy_gibbs
I've spent to much time and energy defending my exes actions to my family and friends. Done with that shit now though. Fuck them.
\"@BabyQuinoonoo: My ex got an STD hahahaha fucking hoe that's what the fuck you get  life is good\" \nLMFAO Twitter has perfect timing!!
Ppl who laugh so hard at their own jokes that they cant even finish the joke bc theyre laughin so hard r my favorite kind of ppl @shy_gibbs
I'm done trying. I made a effort, now its you're turn. I won't wait long. You may have been my first priority before, but not anymore.
\"@AdorableWords: nothing will fuck you up as much as the realization that theres no real reason the alphabet needs to be in order\"
But what if I fall..?  http://t.co/08MsxdfjMm\"

Swisher blunts in the AM. Now heading to Vegas. What a fantastic day.
You can tell how dangerous a person is by the way they hold their anger inside quietly.
She's caught between who she is and who she wants to be.
You'll find us chasing the sun.. &lt;3
@shy_gibbs Nothing.
@shy_gibbs Haha, well put sas.. (:
I can't do this...
\"@CannabisCarter: Clouds are from giraffes taking bong rips.\" \nLmao, greatest theory ever.
The fact that I like and care for you, does not mean I NEED you, don't think I won't walk away.
If you got me, I got you. Simple.
@autocorrects @shy_gibbs This is definitely you me. That's why you rock.

Tomorrow will be a fresh start... I need to make some changes in my life.
Tomorrow will be a fresh start... I need to make some changes in my life.
I know I can do this. I'm just overwhelmed&amp;terrified of messing up, disappointment&amp;well... everything. Just give me time to prove it...
What happened to the confident, happy ready to take on the world person I was before I came back?...
\"Friendships must be built on a solid foundation of sarcasim, inappropriateness and shenanigans\" @shy_gibbs #MyBestFriend
What a fantastic week, got to see my best friend finally! Starting work today. And tomorrow I will be receiving my 90day chip for sobriety.
You can not live life waiting for people to fix you.
@shy_gibbs well if I made it easy, I wouldn't have any fun.
My best friend is better then yours so stick that in your juice box and suck it. Ha.
First AA meeting one week from today. Pretty excited. Had some struggles today being by a bar but thanks to support, I got through it!

You're searching for a better job but I'm searching for a way to give a better job
And the relationships aren't to feed off of someone's resources/money but in a real relationship you help each other on both ends
I'd go to college for the experience before the education cause in my case the relationships I make with people would be more beneficial
Only way I'd go to college is if I knew what job I wanted specifically and know it paid ridicules money with insane benefits
Some of y'all are just wasting your fucking time in college, and it's really sad cause all that money you spend could be invested
Yeah I'm gonna bring myself a life of success and comfort, but I'm not gonna neglect my family in the process.

anyhow, comin up quick on 3 months, and the saga continues
but that's not to say finally feeling pretty great isn't a combination of both
honestly over the course of less than 2 weeks cutting caffeine and nicotine has done more for my psyche than quitting drugs and alcohol
reasonably relaxed, not feeling like i'm going to black out and collapse in crowded places, mind is sharp and RETAINS THINGS,
WOW what a turn of events, no anxiety ridden pressure headaches, feeling like i can trust myself to SPEAK WORDS OUT LOUD TO OTHER PEOPLE

deep-seeded anxty of misrepresenting what i imagine my true intelligence to be forces me to dumb down my perceived behavior as a safety net

@zacharybean my China internet is too garbage for this kind of Twitter action anyway

@zacharybean that was an example. How can you deny the relevancy of continuing to accept the biology of two sexes? It's survival, life
@zacharybean who's talking about baby penises ?
@zacharybean then I ask you mr. bean, is there a purpose to a penis or vagina?
@zacharybean is a doctor letting expecting parents know if their child is a boy or girl ignorant??
@zacharybean is a doctor telling an expecting mother that her child is a boy or a girl ignorant?
@zacharybean society "actively choosing to accept" this is the afterthought to the rule
@zacharybean sure hormones lean either way, but ultimately you have A or B. This is nature's design, not society choosing to accept as such
The longer you exist, the chances of your existence continuing diminish
If you don't look like either this will already be awkward. What will make it worse is if you complicate things further with "preferences"
So just chalk it up to life and accept that people will call you a girl or a boy if you look like one
Isn't adhering to labels what frustrated you in the first place? There will never be a perfect definition of anything in between
Of course there is a spectrum of feeling and interpretation and adaptation in between them. But do you really want to label any of that?
There are 2  biological genders. No way around that. They must be recognized as such for practicality and convenience.
I find it less likely that you truly dislike the word moist all that much and more likely that you're searching for defining characteristics

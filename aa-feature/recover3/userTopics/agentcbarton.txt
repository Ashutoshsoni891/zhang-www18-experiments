Everything worked out really well, actually.
@errantEmber TXT: worse comes to worse, we have boxed pasta.
@errantEmber TXT: we'll find out when we boil it. It also could be flour with a side of egg paste.
@errantEmber TXT: we did. we napped and we made pasta. most likely.
@errantEmber TXT: Si and I made you dinner! Maybe. We'll see.
We'll test it out on Momma when she gets home, okay?
Alright, so, we either made pasta or flour with a side of egg.
@errantEmber TXT: hey, I'm staying home with Si today.
Can't find the energy to get out of bed today.
@errantEmber They're soldiers, that's all they know how to do. [he shook his head, sighing.] Sorry. This is stupid.
@errantEmber Oh, they just called me old. Yknow, never going out anymore. Boring.
@errantEmber Just some stuff the guys said yesterday. 's stupid.
@errantEmber I dunno. I mean, I don't really go out as much anymore.
@errantEmber I'm not boring, right? Just because I don't go out to bars anymore?
@errantEmber Hey. I'm not...boring, am I?
Fuck off, alright?
Yeah, yeah, I know. I don't gamble, I don't drink anymore. Almost like I'm trying to be a good dad to my kid.
No, no, just gonna spend it with the wife and kid. We'll catch up another time.
Nah, that doesn't mean I'm Boring Old Barton, fuck you.
Nah, guys, I'm gonna pass on going out tonight. I don't do that anymore.
Yes, Si, your Da is very old today.
Thirty seven. Oof.
@errantEmber Sure. That sounds really nice.
@errantEmber Sure thing. Want me to grab the monster?
@errantEmber Eeeey. [he grins and wraps his arms around her.] Lets go.
@errantEmber Where do you want to go?
@errantEmber Want to get lunch?
@errantEmber Well thanks, sweetheart. I love you.
@errantEmber I'm okay.
@errantEmber I'm just saying. I'm okay and you're incredible.
@errantEmber [he grins, leaning in to kiss her.]
Oh man I understand that. cc: @errantEmber https://t.co/eSpaXpqmAh
Awh, Si, I love you, kid, but you're getting on Da's nerves tonight.
@RazzleDazzly I'm just saying, I've seen worse people in better positions.
@RazzleDazzly Nah, Tony, I'm not worried, not when you're in the driver's seat.
@RazzleDazzly I'm glad you got it during the holiday-ish time. Are you and Steve tucked away or are you in New York?
Guys who blast obnoxious metal at the gym are the worst kind of people.
Since I can't fucking drink.
I've been smoking a lot more, I've noticed.
Sharing a glass of wine with @errantEmber and it's very hard to not drink the whole damn bottle.
@IronPep Oh fuck yeah. I'm so excited.
@IronPep You go, girl.
@errantEmber It's no problem. It was nice taking it easy with you and Si.
@errantEmber Good. [he smiles and leans in to kiss her forehead.]
@errantEmber Hey, how are you feeling?
@irishwhips So funny. I love it.
@irishwhips Haaaaaaaaaa.
@RazzleDazzly Exactly. It's getting around it and not fucking up everything that's hard. How was your New Year's Eve?
@RazzleDazzly You're pretty great, Tony.
Making @errantEmber breakfast in bed. Si is on coffee duty.
As always, @errantEmber is my New Years kiss.
I'm...trying to not get drunk tonight.
@errantEmber [he smiles, grabbing his phone.] Ill make reservations.
@errantEmber Great. [he leans in to kiss her.] Want to go out to dinner?
@errantEmber [he laughs, leaning in to kiss her.] Wanna stay in?
@errantEmber Hey. What are your plans tonight?
Napping on my desk today. The rest of the year can suck it.
Can people stop dying holy shit.
All I want is a beer, holy shit.
Okay. Trying this whole sober thing again.
@IronPep What the fuuuuuuuck.
Princess Leia died what the fuck.
Clearing the liquor out of the house.
@errantEmber I got sorta mean last night. You really are doing everything you can, with me and Si and the company. And you're doing great.
@errantEmber I should. I know I've been shitty. Especially to you.
@errantEmber I know. I should have been. But I didn't. And I'm sorry.
@errantEmber I know. I haven't been doing so great with sobriety lately.
@errantEmber Eight. I actually put Si to bed drunk.
@errantEmber How...how much did you think I had to drink that night?
@errantEmber You're welcome, baby. I'm sorry about the other night. I went a little overboard.
Merry Christmas, @errantEmber. Love you. https://t.co/eHxpzrTrzL
Nothing like being woken up by a kid jumping on your bed babbling loudly about Santa in a half-American, half-English accent.
@errantEmber I'm okay. Just okay.
@errantEmber You shouldn't. You're beautiful and talented and our son is great.
@errantEmber But you're doing so fucking well. You've barely made any mistakes.
@errantEmber married that got a fucking OUI.
@errantEmber I'm okay. But compared to who you are? Shit, Em. You're known for being so smart and savvy and I'm the American she --
I should probably stop doing that since Si will be old enough to read soon.
Every year. Not sorry, @errantEmber. https://t.co/V3PpO7fAKp
Skipped work on Friday. Felt like hell and it's Christmas anyway.
@AgentRomanova Are you leaving already?
@AgentRomanova I know. But I should. I want to support Emily.
@AgentRomanova It's because I need to dress up to impress them. I hate these money suits.
@AgentRomanova I just really hate being all dressed up at events like this.
@RazzleDazzly He does, he's loud like dad and opinionated like mum. Behaved like a gentleman at Emily's Christmas party.
@AgentRomanova I'm fine. It's fine.
@RazzleDazzly London's okay. Yknow. I'm still partial to New York but Si seems to like all the lights. You spending a quiet New Years too?
@RazzleDazzly Same, man. How's New York? All lit up?
@RazzleDazzly Merry Christmas, Tony.
@AgentRomanova [he took a sip of his beer, sighing.]
@errantEmber Because you are so talented an am now a business owner. Nothing wrong with that.
@errantEmber [he rubs a hand over his face, shaking his head.] No, no. It's not your fault. You've always been so great and so amazing.
@AgentRomanova Awh, you're sweet. [he clinks his glass against hers.]
@errantEmber I don't know. I don't know why I care so much. I don't want to.
@AgentRomanova Cheers. To my favorite Russian spy.
@irishwhips Cool. I'm down for that.
@errantEmber I know you don't. But I do.
@errantEmber None of them think so.
@errantEmber I just hate feeling like I'm not good enough for you.
@errantEmber 's fine. I should know by now. What it's like. What I'm like.
@errantEmber [he digs out his cigarettes, fumbling with the lighter as he lights the cigarette.]
@errantEmber [he closes his eyes, sighing.] Fine. Okay. Let's...let's just get out of here.
@irishwhips Would you tell me with your mouth?
@irishwhips Basically I'm going to tell you you're great until you get annoyed with mu voice and you tell me to shut up.
@irishwhips I can be pretty persuasive.
Joke's on her - I drank before we came here, too.
I can't believe she's doing this.
@errantEmber [he closes his eyes, leaning his head back.] Fine. Fine. I'll leave. Protect the precious company. I'm going for a smoke.
@errantEmber Are you serious? Em. 'm -fine-. I'm not embarrassing you like you're always so worried about at these parties.
@errantEmber I'm seriously fine. Really. Let's just kiss and hen you can go back to everything.
@irishwhips [he smiles, winking.] You should.
@errantEmber small talk. Not causing any trouble.
@errantEmber Uh oh, I'm getting kicked out already? [he wraps an arm around her waist.] Cmon. I'm fine. I'm out of the way, making --
@irishwhips Maybe. I'm gonna err on the side that you're great always.
@irishwhips All of the time, yes.
@errantEmber Maybe because I just like you a lot.
@errantEmber What? [he snorts, shaking his head.] 'm barely even buzzed, baby.
@errantEmber [he smiles, weaving a bit on his feet.] Thanks, love. Merry Christmas.
@AgentRomanova [he comes back with a glass, handing her one.]
@irishwhips God you're great.
@errantEmber 'm not that tired. Yknow. It's a pastry, it's fun, or whatever.
I just want to get out of here.
She'd be pissed if she know how much I had to drink before I put Simon down.
@AgentRomanova Sure thing. I'll go grab it for you.!
@AgentRomanova What do you want? I'll get it for you.
@IronPep Nah, nah, 'm fine. Cmon, Pep. Have some fun.
@errantEmber 'm fine. Just, been' making conversation with the bartender. Yknow.
@AgentRomanova Not investors. [he smirks.] Want a drink?
@errantEmber Glad I could help. [he kisses her cheek.]
@errantEmber [Clint comes up behind her, placing a hand on her lower back.] Hey, sorry, but the little monster wants to see his mom.
@errantEmber TXT: want me to rescue you from that conversation because that dude looks like he sucks
@AgentRomanova Nah, nah. My wife's. Shes a businesswoman and everyone is awful.
@AgentRomanova And I don't think the world is going to be getting quiet any time soon.
@errantEmber TXT: gonna go see how Si's doing
I wasn't going to get a fucking chip anyway. Waste of time.
@AgentRomanova Yknow. The regular. Working for what seems like forever.
@IronPep [he pours her a glass, some of it spilling over the side.] Cheers.
Drunk.
@AgentRomanova What else have you been up to? Other than kicking ass.
@AgentRomanova I'll see what I can do. I've missed working like that.
Em is off making conversation. I'm just going to hang by the bar.
@AgentRomanova I really do too. [he bumps his shoulder against hers.]
@AgentRomanova Of course it did. You're the one that was there.
@AgentRomanova Where was it? I assumed that you kicked ass.
Si's asleep. I guess I should head back down.
@AgentRomanova I'm okay. Yknow. How are you?
@AgentRomanova You bet. I absolutely did.
Okay, Si. One last book.
@AgentRomanova Awful, Tasha. Awful.
Glad to get away from this fucking party.
@errantEmber [he nods, leaning in to kiss her.] I'll be back soon.
@errantEmber Yeah. Is his bag already up there?
@errantEmber That sounds great, actually. [he downs the whiskey, placing the glass upside down.] I'll see you in a bit?
@errantEmber That sounds great, actually. [he downs the whiskey, placing the glass upside down.] I'll see you in a bit?
@errantEmber [he nodded, glancing over at her.] I'm going to go hang it with Si.
@errantEmber [his nerves were settling as he motioned for another drink.] Good. That's great.
@errantEmber Okay. Good. [he runs a hand through his hair, nodding.] Seems to be going good, though.
@errantEmber How's he been to Si?
@errantEmber Fine. Yknow. Avoiding your dad. So fine.
@errantEmber [he looks over at her, smiling, already a little drunk.] Hey.
No, neat. Thanks.
I'm going to have another scotch, yeah.
Just shared looks with Emily's dad.
Yeah, scotch, neat, please.
Bar? Bar.
I'm fucking nervous.
@errantEmber [he runs a hand through his hair, smiling down at Simon.]
@errantEmber Okay. Good. [he sighs, picking up Si.] Let's go.
@errantEmber [he grimaced, looking up at her.] That obvious?
@errantEmber Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready to go.
It's the first time I've seen her parents since...since crashing my car.
@errantEmber Thanks. You look amazing.
Ready to party with @errantEmber tonight. https://t.co/1pKFejk96S
@errantEmber Obviously. [he smirks.]
@errantEmber Yeah, yeah. [he leans over, tapping his phone to change it to Christmas music.] Better?
Dancing around the kitchen with @errantEmber. She's tolerating country music - though that may also be the wine.
@_Lightbreaker Marshmallows are pretty great.
@_Lightbreaker So true. Best with whiskey.
Like, so cold I want to die, cold.
It's fucking cold.
@errantEmber The small stuff like that.
@errantEmber That's why i got you to marry me.
@errantEmber Charming is a word. [he smirks, opening his drawer and pulling out a few ties.]
@errantEmber He helps. More than I do.
@errantEmber He can sweet talk all the people you're trying to impress.
I'm trying. For real this year.
@errantEmber I thought we could match. Have Si in a red shirt or something.
@errantEmber [he smiles against her lips, wrapping his arms around her waist.] Want to help me pick out a tie?
@errantEmber [he laughs, shaking his head.] Aw, thanks.
@errantEmber Yeah. I haven't picked a tie yet, though. I want it to match your dress.
@errantEmber You're welcome.
@errantEmber All of them are good on you.
@errantEmber What color is your dress?
@errantEmber When's your holiday party? This week, right?
Whoaaa. https://t.co/SMEgC3A4p4
Nothing like spinning out and almost crashing my car. I love London.
@irishwhips Whoa.
@errantEmber I love you too, Emily.
@errantEmber I'm glad I got someone as forgiving as you.
@errantEmber your life forever.
@errantEmber [he snorted.] Remember when you found out I was Clint, instead of Barney? I thought you were going to throw me out of --
@errantEmber [he begins to play with her hair, smiling softly.] How did I get so lucky?
@errantEmber [he had changed into joggers, setting his phone aside as she crawled into bed.] Hey.
@errantEmber [he watches her go, tossing the clothes in the hamper before heading to the bedroom.]
@errantEmber That sounds good to me. [he leans in to kiss her quickly.] Love you.
@errantEmber [he kisses her back, running a hand through her hair.]
@errantEmber I got it. [he squeezes her gently before kissing her shoulder, sliding out of her.]
@errantEmber We don't have to. But, I think the bed might be better for what's next.
@errantEmber [he wraps both arms around her, grinning into her shoulder.]
@errantEmber [he just breathes out a laugh in reply, taking the hand off of her, and placing it on her stomach.] I fucking love you.
@errantEmber [she clenches around him, hard, as he follows her, heat spiking up his spine as he works her through it.]
@errantEmber [he thrusts into her had, changing the direction of his thumb as he digs his fingers into her hip, stomach tight.]
@errantEmber C'mon, Em. [his pace picks up, breathing hard against her shoulder.]
@errantEmber [he loves the way he feels around her, hot and tight. he kisses her shoulder as he thrusts into her, breathing out sharply.]
Undercover Boss sometimes makes me cry like a little bitch.
@errantEmber [he groans her name, leaning his against his shoulder as he changes his pace.]
@irishwhips That sounds amazing.
@irishwhips Oh fuck yes. Are they footie pajamas?
@irishwhips Shit. That sounds incredible. Clothes optional, right?
@irishwhips God, that sounds like an incredible Christmas.
@errantEmber I'm all yours, Em. To get like this whenever you want me to.
@irishwhips I know what to get you for Christmas.
@irishwhips Chocolate is pretty amazing.
@errantEmber [he thrusted into her hard, nipping along her shoulder.] Not gonna, baby.
@errantEmber You're incredible. You know that? You drive me crazy every day and I fucking love it.
@errantEmber [he rests his forehead against her shoulder, groaning her name.]
@errantEmber [he changes the pace of his hips, groaning at the feel of her around him.]
@errantEmber [he grins at her groan, pressing kisses to the back of her neck.]
@irishwhips Candy pumpkins are the best candy.
@errantEmber [he reached forward, rubbing at her clit, thrusting his hips into her.]
@errantEmber [he moves a hand to her lower back, groaning.]
@irishwhips Also, candy.
@errantEmber [he sighed, pushing into her again.] I love you, Emily.
@errantEmber You feel so amazing, baby. [he groaned, digging his fingers into her hip.]
@irishwhips Halloween is pretty great.
@errantEmber [he slides into her slowly, groaning.]
@irishwhips Neither my brother or I have super been into the holidays.
@irishwhips Oh, yeah. I remember that one, I think.
@errantEmber [he steps out of his own boxers, rubbing a thumb into her hip.]
@errantEmber That's part of the point, doll. [he grins and tugs at her underwear, sliding it down.]
@irishwhips It's totally weird, no doubt.
@errantEmber And I love leavin' them on you.
@irishwhips Do you like the Santa Clause?
@errantEmber [he grinned, tightening his teeth a little more before letting go.] Going to have a few extra jewels for your holiday party.
@errantEmber God, you're beautiful. [he moaned softly and sunk his teeth into her shoulder.]
@errantEmber [he groaned, pausing for a second before pushing her shirt over her head, down her arms.]
@errantEmber [he hikes it up around her ribs.] Lift your arms.
@errantEmber [he takes a step closer to her, slipping his hands up her shirt, dragging his fingertips down her sides.]
@errantEmber [he undoes the button on his own pants, taking his shirt and tossing it aside.]
@errantEmber I can imagine. Because you do the same damn thing to me. Now get those pants off.
@errantEmber [he finally lets go, kissing down her neck.]
@errantEmber [he obliges, digging his fingers into her hips.]
@errantEmber [he grins wolfishly at her as he steps forward, biting a bruise into her neck.]
@errantEmber [he nods, grabbing his drink to toss it back.] Yeah. That'll work.
@irishwhips We can go back to my place and watch Christmas movies. Or dumb horror movies.
@errantEmber How about this fucking bar? [he grins, smacking her ass.] C'mere.
@irishwhips [he smiles as he kisses her.] Want to go get a drink?
@errantEmber Mm, and I'll gladly take the blame.
@irishwhips You do both. Maybe one better than the other. [he smirks, kissing her.]
@errantEmber Jesus. [he digs his fingers into her waist, grinning.] You're a minx.
@irishwhips There's a lot of truth to that.
@irishwhips You're a fighter. Kicking ass in more ways than one.
@errantEmber Yeah? You think about this when you're in your meetings? With all the execs?
@irishwhips I'm glad you made the decision.
@errantEmber I love -you-. You drive me wild, Emily.
@irishwhips Yeah, it could be.
@errantEmber [he wraps his arms around her waist, sliding her closer to him. he moves their drinks out of the way, nipping her neck.]
@errantEmber [he finally pulls back, kissing down her jawbone.] I love you.
@errantEmber [he twists a hand in her hair, deepening the kiss.]
@errantEmber You'll certainly have a good time here. [he clinks his glass against hers.]
@errantEmber Come here often, sweetheart? [he leans in to kiss her temple, handing her the drink.]
@errantEmber [he hummed to himself as he made the drinks, listening as Emily bid Si goodnight.]
@errantEmber [he smiles, smacking her ass before moving to the kitchen.]
@irishwhips [he kisses her cheek again, rubbing her back.]
@irishwhips It must be hard not being around them.
@irishwhips When did it start?
@irishwhips No, I get it.
@irishwhips [he wraps his arms around her, kissing her cheek.]
@irishwhips [he squeezes her shoulder.]
@errantEmber I'll make some drinks.
@irishwhips I bet it makes you miss Canada.
@irishwhips Is it nice, having them around?
@errantEmber Yes. Let's totally do that.
@errantEmber [he wraps his arms around her waist, pulling her close.]
@irishwhips That sounds great. How are they?
@errantEmber [he's taken by surprise, kissing her back firmly.]
@irishwhips Are you going anywhere special?
@errantEmber I love you too. Forever, yeah?
@irishwhips You look amazing.
@errantEmber You're sweet. [he kisses get forehead.]
@irishwhips So good.
@irishwhips [bug eyes] Whoa.
Throwback to two Christmases ago. She looks the same because she's more superhero than me. Love you, @errantEmber. https://t.co/3vq0rGsSGd
@errantEmber I did. I wanted to treat you.
@errantEmber [he wraps his arm around her shoulders, smiling as he gave the waiter his name.] Its cold outside.
@errantEmber I thought we should. It's been a while.
@errantEmber Good. I'm glad. [he grins, taking her hand.] Cmon.
@errantEmber Nooo. What? [he smirks, leaning in to kiss her.]
@errantEmber Hi. [he hurriedly stubs out his cigarette.]
@errantEmber TXT: I'm outside.
@errantEmber TXT: love you.
@errantEmber TXT: 11 Upper Saint Martin's Lane.
@errantEmber TXT: out. :)
@errantEmber TXT: Cool. Si is with Carol.
@errantEmber TXT: dinner tonight? My treat?
Almost lost my keys this morning. Everything is fine.
It's not often that I'm at work later than Em.
@errantEmber [he wraps an arm around her shoulders.] Hungry?
@errantEmber [Clint smiles and gives her a kiss on her cheek.] We missed you.
@errantEmber [Simon runs up to her first, closely followed by Clint.] Hey, Mum. How was your day?
@errantEmber TXT: Si and I will be waiting for you.
@errantEmber TXT: I'll pick up dinner. Italian okay?
@errantEmber TXT: lunch and a little bit of hookey?
I tried to quit smoking after I got home from overseas. Turns out, I'm really bad at quitting things.
@errantEmber It starts at seven.
@errantEmber Yeah. Family of the kid that died over there, too.
@errantEmber [he smiled, leaning in to kiss her.] They wanted to meet the amazing Emily Barton-Moore.
@errantEmber O'Neils. They booked out an area of it.
@errantEmber The guys from my unit are getting together for dinner. I'd like you and Si to come.
@errantEmber Hey, what are you doing Friday?
@errantEmber Si, why don't you go grab Mum a mug for her coffee?
@errantEmber We've got a chef on our hands. [he smiled, picking Si up.]
@errantEmber [Clint grins, leaning in to kiss her cheek.] C'mon. The Monster is starving. And so am I.
@errantEmber Nah, I just gave our two-year old a knife and was like, eh, fuck it, it'll be fine.
@errantEmber I helped him. He didn't have the knife to himself.
@errantEmber A scramble, with onions and peppers and home fries and eggs. Si helped me chop the potatoes.
@errantEmber Si and I cooked tons of food - and we need your help to eat it all, Momma.
Si and I woke up @errantEmber for breakfast!
Spent the whole day in bed with @errantEmber and Si watching Christmas movies.
Nope.
I never really used to mind kid-dying movies, but after Si...
@errantEmber I fucking love you too, Emily.
@errantEmber [he wraps his arms around her, dragging his fingertips down her spine.] We're not that far off.
@errantEmber [he laughs softly, untucking her shirt.] Yeah? Maybe I should go all gray.
@errantEmber Yeah? [he moves a bit closer to her, slipping a hand under her shirt.] How hot?
@errantEmber It is not that hot. It makes me old.
@errantEmber [pouts.] Ow.
@errantEmber At least none of it was gray this year.
@errantEmber [laughs, leaning in to kiss her.] I guess.
@errantEmber Okay, okay. [he rubbed his clean-shaven face.]
@errantEmber It would be so festive!
@errantEmber Yesyesyesyes. It's gonna be -great-.
I'm going to keep the beard and buy beard ornaments and @errantEmber can't stop me.
@errantEmber Whaaaat who me?
@errantEmber [she clenches around him as she cries out and he's not too far after her, digging his fingers into her hips.]
@errantEmber Nothin' can pull me away from you, baby. [he half-groans it, changing his pace.]
@errantEmber [he tugs at her hair, groaning as she clenches around him.]
@errantEmber Fuck -yes- I do. [he drags his fingertips down her side, thumb rubbing at her.]
@errantEmber You drive me crazy. Every day, you know that?
@errantEmber [he twisted one hand in her hair, another resting on the wall as he rocked into her.]
@errantEmber God, Emily. [he groans at the feel of her, pressing his body against hers.]
@errantEmber [he finally pushes into her, groaning.]
@errantEmber Yes ma'am. [he moves her legs, wrapping them around his waist, brushing against her.]
@errantEmber Yes ma'am. [he moves her legs, wrapping them around his waist, brushing against her.]
@errantEmber [he watches her, grinning before tugging off his boxers.] I fucking -love- you.
@errantEmber Back up against that wall. I'm going to wrap you around me and fuck you until you scream.
@errantEmber Meant to. [he grins, stepping back to kick his pants off.]
@errantEmber Good. It's what I do. [he tugs her underwear and it rips.]
@errantEmber [he grins, wrapping his fingers in the band of her underwear.] You're fucking beautiful.
@errantEmber I know. And I love it. [he nips her neck one last time.] Get those fucking pants off.
@errantEmber Yeah? [he grins, pressing his hips against hers.] I love taking it from you.
@errantEmber I fucking -adore- it. Watching you get all dressed up in heels and the marks I put on you.
@errantEmber Proper Misses Moore is going into board meetings with hickeys. [he grins, leaning in to make another mark.]
@errantEmber I know. [he grins and leans in to nip at her neck, intending to leave a mark.]
@errantEmber I love you too. To the moon and back, Em. [he presses her up against the wall, popping the button on her jeans.]
@errantEmber Jesus Christ. [he grins and sinks a hand into her hair.]
@errantEmber [he reaches around to undo her bra and flicking it across the room.]
@errantEmber Yes. Yes, yes yes. [he works at her shirt, pulling it off.]
@errantEmber Naaaah. [he grins and leans in to kiss her.] Love you.
@errantEmber You're perfect.
@errantEmber I like that idea. I'm sure we'll be able to tire the monster out.
@errantEmber Great. Anything scheduled with your mom?
@errantEmber Great. [he leans in to kiss her.] Doing a company holiday party again this year?
@errantEmber I'm sure we do. Maybe the real one in he living room, fake one in the dining room?
@errantEmber [Clint grins as Simon starts singing along.] I'll move stuff around to make sure we have enough room.
@errantEmber We have room for both?
@errantEmber [he laughs] Yeah? I'll look at a few places so we can go pick one up.
.@errantEmber is so ready to start decorating for Christmas. I don't know where she gets it.
Once in a while the bow comes out and it feels great. She feels great.
@errantEmber [he kisses down her jaw, pushing her shirt up.]
@errantEmber [he brings her into the bedroom, tossing her onto the bed.]
@errantEmber [he lifts her up, wrapping her legs around his waist.]
@errantEmber [a grin splits his face.] Hell yeah.
@errantEmber And you're the best thing that's ever happened to me.
@errantEmber He's the greatest thing I've ever done.
@errantEmber It's also pretty cute when he switches between your accent and mine.
@errantEmber [he laughs, running the back of his head.] Sorry.
@errantEmber That and leaping off of the back of the couch. That's all me too.
@errantEmber It's insane. He gets it all from you.
@errantEmber [he leans in to kiss her again.] Si knew something was wrong.
@errantEmber It's not fine. What I did was shitty.
@errantEmber And I'm sorry. About everything earlier. I was an asshole and paranoid.
@errantEmber Much. [he leans in to kiss her.] I love you.
@errantEmber It was a great trip.
Finally home. Teaming up with @errantEmber to put the monster to bed.
@errantEmber It's not your fault.
@errantEmber Yeah. It's usually because we're fighting about other stuff when I throw insults at your dad.
@errantEmber I've said some pretty nasty things to him. And about him.
@errantEmber dad, and even you, go into that category.
@errantEmber It's not just that. There's a step in AA. It's like, coming to terms with people you've hurt because of your drinking. Your --
@errantEmber I know. But I have to at least try, right? Even if he just wants to talk about how terrible I am.
@errantEmber I just want to mend fences. Especially with your father.
@errantEmber I've been doing a lot of thinking. And being in AA and all...your parents have never seen a good side of me.
@errantEmber I was thinking...we should have dinner with your parents.
@errantEmber I am too. But it was needed. To get away from everything.
@errantEmber Cheers. [he taps his bottle against hers.]
@errantEmber Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.
@errantEmber [he comes back around half an hour later.] He's finally out.
@errantEmber Yep. [he throws Si over his shoulders.] Cmon, monster.
@errantEmber ["No!"] Yeeeah, bud. C'mon, we've got a long drive to home tomorrow.
@errantEmber You're still amazing.
@errantEmber He's amazing. Just like his Momma. [he leans in, kissing her.]
@errantEmber [Simon crawls on his lap, thrusting out a picture he drew.] Man, Si, that's incredible. You're an artist.
@errantEmber One day.
@errantEmber Let's stay here forever.
@errantEmber Yeah. I know.
@errantEmber Si asked if everything was okay between us.
Streaming the Thanksgiving Day parade with Simon. He's totally entranced.
@irishwhips That's what I thought too.
Drunk with @errantEmber in Scotland.
He knows something is going on between Em and I. He's too perceptive for a toddler.
Safely in Saint Andrews. Si is running around, exploring our rental.
@errantEmber Sounds good. I can do that.
@irishwhips Yeah. Suddenly you're ten years older.
@errantEmber I'll pick up stuff for dinner.
@irishwhips Day to day shit is the worst.
@irishwhips [he laughs, shaking his head.]
@irishwhips Its on top of a list.
@errantEmber Great. [he nods, running a hand through his hair.] I'll see you at home in a bit?
@irishwhips Ever think about going again? Just for the fuck of it?
@errantEmber And...do you still want to go to Saint Andrews?
@errantEmber [he nods.] I'll cook something for dinner, too.
@errantEmber Yeah. Yeah, I'll...I can leave you alone for a bit with Si if you want.
@errantEmber Do you want to go home?
@errantEmber [he stared down at her desk, sighing.]
@errantEmber I'm fucking sorry, okay?
@errantEmber I know, I know, I just...i got upset and didn't stop and fucking think.
@errantEmber I didn't know what to think. I knew we were on real shaky ground before I left. And when I was gone.
@errantEmber [he nods, meeting her eyes.] And I'm sorry I jumped to conclusions so fast.
@errantEmber I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I just...jesus. I don't know.
@errantEmber I want to stay with you. I love you, Emily. Even though we fight like this.
@errantEmber What are we going to do?
@errantEmber [he folds his arms across his chest, sighing.] I don't...I don't want to fight like this.
@errantEmber You do get why I'm fucking upset, though?
@errantEmber [he closes his eyes, blowing out a long breath before looking at her.] What's wrong with us?
@errantEmber You -know- that's not what I'm trying to do, Emily. Seriously.
@errantEmber I am -not- the asshole here.
@errantEmber [he groans, dropping his head in his hands.]
@errantEmber I didn't think you did. I'm wondering now.
@errantEmber I will when you will. When your dad does.
@errantEmber You said yes to go out with someone that was in your own social class, so yeah, I'm thinking it did.
@errantEmber you almost did.
@errantEmber Well things aren't fucking normal anymore, Em. I spent the last hour thinking you had thrown this marriage away. And --
@errantEmber I had to drag that fucking answer from you. You don't see anything wrong with this?
@errantEmber I can't fucking -believe- you.
@errantEmber fucking -told- me! But no, let's keep it a secret from your own damn husband. Good idea, Em.
@errantEmber I fucking found out from a tabloid! Do you think this is fucking going well? It would have gone so much better if you had --
@errantEmber from a -tabloid-. Why can't you trust me and our own fucking marriage to -tell- me?
@errantEmber Why didn't you tell me any of this as soon as I got home? Or while I was away? Emily, I had to fucking find this out --
@errantEmber [he takes a few breathes before finally meeting her eyes.] Okay. Level with me.
@errantEmber This wasn't -just- for work. Do you think I'm that fucking -stupid-, Emily? Jesus!
@errantEmber You fucking went to -dinner- with him, Emily!
@errantEmber [he closes his eyes, running a hand through his hair.] Did you see anyone else?
@errantEmber You know what I fucking mean by friendly, Emily. Don't get all sassy on me.
@errantEmber But you still kissed him on the cheek. It looked pretty fucking friendly to me.
@errantEmber And he doesn't give a shit if you're married? Why the hell did you go out with him when you knew he felt that way?
@errantEmber Then why the fuck did you kiss his cheek, Em? Seriously. That's not a fucking working dinner.
@errantEmber another man.] Because I didn't peg you as one to cheat, Em, I really fucking didn't.
@errantEmber I was just wondering. [he shrugged one shoulder, pulling out his phone and pulling up the photos of her kissing the cheek of --
@errantEmber What did you get up to while I was away? Meet anybody new?
@errantEmber [the smile doesn't reach his eyes as he kisses her.] Hey.
@errantEmber [he comes into her office around ten minutes later, salad in hand.]
I know I shouldn't jump to conclusions - but I can't stop thinking about it:
@errantEmber TXT: Yeah. What would you like?
@errantEmber TXT: Yeah. Let's let lunch.
I feel like I'm going to throw up.
@errantEmber TXT: We need to talk. Now.
Are you serious.
@irishwhips Yeah? Does he still have it?
@errantEmber Great. [he smiles.] I'm excited to go.
@irishwhips Seriously. I grew up in the plains of Iowa.
@errantEmber Are you okay to leave Wednesday?
@irishwhips It would be fun. To see that again.
@errantEmber I love you.
@errantEmber Holy. Shit.
@irishwhips It sounds pretty great.
@irishwhips Ha. Those are the best fishing trips.
@errantEmber Me too. It'll be nice to get away from the city.
@errantEmber One of the kids overseas was from there. He wouldn't stop talking about it.
@irishwhips It must have been beautiful to see the stars.
@irishwhips Sleeping in igloos sound fucking awesome.
@irishwhips It's the only way to sleep. Period.
@errantEmber And Scotland is beautiful.
@irishwhips Exactly. Sleeping in the summer is the worst. You get all sticky.
@errantEmber Want to go up north? Scotland, maybe?
@irishwhips Now we're on the same thought. [he grins, winking.]
@irishwhips Totally true.
@errantEmber I was looking into it, a little. I wasn't sure what your schedule looked like.
@irishwhips Same. I'd rather be under ten blankets.
@irishwhips That's true. Who wants to wear pants sleeping, anyway?
@irishwhips You do you, girl.
@irishwhips Hanging out with no pants on is pretty incredible.
@irishwhips Leggings. Isn't that what they're for?
@errantEmber Hey. Wanna do Thanksgiving away from here?
Successfully convinced UNIT to give me Thanksgiving off again. Basically the only good thing about being a US citizen still.
@errantEmber Yes ma'am. [he grins, letting go of her shirt.]
@errantEmber [he grins, mood lightening.] Okay. I can do that.
@errantEmber Is that bed or... -bed-?
@errantEmber [he kisses her back, wrapping his fingers in her shirt.]
@errantEmber [he leans in to rest his forehead against hers.] Sorry, sorry. Long year.
@errantEmber Yeah, but, shit, Em. I'm turning thirty-seven.
@errantEmber Really? You honestly don't think I'm too old?
@errantEmber [he grumbles, wrapping his arms around her waist.] Fine.
@errantEmber [he pouts, trying to hide the gray.]
@errantEmber I mean. As long as you don't think I'm centuries old.
@errantEmber ...really?
@errantEmber I'm -old-.
@errantEmber Em help I have a gray hair I'm so old I'm fucking -ancient-.
Ah, shit.
No, no. That is not a gray hair.
@errantEmber You always do. [he trails his hand up her back, bunching up her shirt.]
@errantEmber Bit too long. I haven't really seen you.
@errantEmber [he slips a hand under her shirt, panting.]
@errantEmber Yeah. [he grins and leans in to kiss her.]
@errantEmber [he smiles and leans in to kiss her.] How about you show me?
@errantEmber Good. Because I'm all yours.
@errantEmber I'll still be here. You ain't getting rid of me anytime soon.
@errantEmber C'mere. [he pulls her into his lap, running a hand through her hair.] I'll be here for you. No matter what you choose.
@errantEmber It would be great to see you more. So would love to see you more, too.
@errantEmber No, no I just...I just wasn't sure if you were joking or not.
@errantEmber Are...are you serious?
@errantEmber [he sits up, making eye contact with her.] What?
@errantEmber No, no. Don't apologize. It's not your fault.
@errantEmber You'd think we'd have this ships-passing-in-the-night routine down or something.
@errantEmber [he sighs and kisses her cheek.] I love you.
@errantEmber It's so scary. I'm worried about Tony and Steve.
@errantEmber there for school or anything.
@errantEmber I know...it's probably stupid, to be upset about the elections. Since I live over here and Si won't be going over --
@errantEmber [he leans his head on her shoulder.] Thanks for doing this with me.
Splitting a bottle of wine with @errantEmber. Just like old times.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: Em and I picked out some cheese and chocolates, Si drew a picture of Iron Man and Captain America, it'll be there tmrw.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: she can share.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: also cmon baby you know you want to put a ring on this.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: you let me know what I can do to help over here.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: will do. And if you ever need to get away, you give me a ring.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: Come over. It wouldn't hurt anyone here.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: I did, yeah. Yknow.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: fuck man, I even voted.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: I mean. Not your fault.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: man, I'm sorry. Let me know if you need anything from across the pond.
@irishwhips 'm alright. I guess.
@irishwhips How are you doing?
@irishwhips How are you doing?
@RazzleDazzly TXT: hey. in the wake of everything, how are you and Steve doing?
@irishwhips Shit, man. You're right.
@irishwhips Holy shit.
@irishwhips What in the actual fuck happened?
What. The fuck just happened.
What the fuck is going on.
@irishwhips Man, I don't live there anymore, but holy shit. I'm waiting with baited breath.
Hey America. Vote today. I did by absentee.
@errantEmber I know. For our family.
@errantEmber Thanks, baby. I really appreciate everything you've done for me.
@errantEmber I'm alright.
@errantEmber I'm just really lucky to have you.
Sometimes you need your best friend in your corner. I'm lucky to have @errantEmber.
@errantEmber Simon likes it.
@errantEmber Cmon, you love me and my bearded face.
@errantEmber HAHAHAHA.
Holy shit, Cubs.
Oh my god it's No Shave November I totally forgot until right now.
@RazzleDazzly Hey. Thanks for coming with me to that meeting.
@RazzleDazzly [Clint nodded, slightly satisfied with the answer. he watching Simon for a bit before speaking again.] How's New York?
@RazzleDazzly and extreme. [Simon giggles and Clint shakes his head.] Don't you repeat that word to mum, alright, Si?
@RazzleDazzly I'm not binning it. I don't -need- it. Yes, I made some really awful judgement calls but their program is fucking extravagant-
@RazzleDazzly more of a reason to despise me. Seriously, Tony.
@RazzleDazzly What, do you think I'm not taking it seriously? I am. Jesus, man. I fucking crashed my car and gave Em's dad even --
@RazzleDazzly like that his whole life. he had left his family - Simon - for six months to run away from a problem.] Well...
@RazzleDazzly [Clint twisted his fingers together, not being able to look in Tony's eyes. he was right - he had been making decisions --
@RazzleDazzly or to fill out a sheet or counseling or any of that.
@RazzleDazzly Because I don't need treatment. It was a one time thing. I fucked up, really bad, one time. That's it. I don't need treatment-
@RazzleDazzly doesn't mean I had to do it.
@RazzleDazzly No, I mean...I was sentenced to go, not necessarily participate. I got the form, yknow, kinda looked it over but that --
@RazzleDazzly We can call them problems, or whatever. I'm fine with that. But I don't think alcoholic is the right word.
@RazzleDazzly word to use.
@RazzleDazzly [he bristles at the word, setting Si down as he moves to the kitchen.] Well. I mean. I dunno if alcoholic is the best --
@RazzleDazzly [Simon nods, grabbing his crayons.] Thanks for coming all the way out here. I really do appreciate it.
@RazzleDazzly We can sit. Little man is good to run around the house while we chat.
@RazzleDazzly [Si laughs and Clint grins as he rolls his eyes.] Okay. Coffee instead?
@NotADeadHoofer TXT: Will do Cap x
@RazzleDazzly Tony.] Want some tea? Must have been a long flight, even in that.
@RazzleDazzly Ah, no, I've been a little behind on things. But I'm sure we'll catch up. [he rubbed Si's back, who was clinging to --
@RazzleDazzly whistling.] Whoa. New paint job?
@RazzleDazzly We might be. Everything has been so crazy that we actually haven't thought about it. [he looks over the suit, --
@RazzleDazzly Mum gets home.
@RazzleDazzly [Si laughs with excitement, reaching out to grab a hold of his Uncle Tony.] Perfect, wind him up with sugar before --
@RazzleDazzly fingers into the suit jacket. maybe he seeded this more than he realized - his friends.]
@RazzleDazzly [Clint is almost surprised, taken aback for a second before leaning in, wrapping an arm around Tony's waist, twisting his --
@RazzleDazzly it starts raining.
@RazzleDazzly [Clint watches Tony land with Si on his hip, who's clapping wildly.] Hey, Uncle Tony. We've got maybe a half an hour before --
@NotADeadHoofer TXT: however bad Tony says it is, it isn't that bad.
@RazzleDazzly Hey man, feel free to use the roof. We can find a place to store it in the apartment.
@RazzleDazzly Submerging into the Atlantic is probably seen as bad. Give me the heads up when you're a half an hour out.
@errantEmber [Clint kisses Si's cheek, smiling.] Hey bud.
@RazzleDazzly Took the day off. What time are you flying in?
@errantEmber Yknow, just one while I was waiting. No big deal.
@RazzleDazzly The election is only talked about a little over here, thank god. And it's okay to call them problems. They are problems.
@errantEmber No, not too long. I got us some appetizers.
@errantEmber [he smiles and stands, leaning in to kiss her cheek.] Hey, baby.
@RazzleDazzly Oh fuck, Halloween, I totally forgot.
@errantEmber TXT: xx
@RazzleDazzly Sure thing. I'll make sure we get the guest bed ready and some freakish English candy.
@errantEmber TXT: Yeah, bring the little monster.
@RazzleDazzly You okay?
@errantEmber TXT: dinner?
So excited to go home and put my face in a pint.
@errantEmber I love you too.
@errantEmber [he nods, taking one of her hands and squeezing it.] Thanks.
@errantEmber Not at all?
@errantEmber [he grits his teeth but nods.] What are they saying?
@irishwhips You sure do.
@errantEmber Slowly but surely. Has...do your parents know?
@RazzleDazzly Hey whoa, wait, I'm not forty.
@errantEmber Yeah. But. More on you. You've had to deal with me, Si, and your business.
@RazzleDazzly I thought it would be fine, I was so, so wrong.
@RazzleDazzly I tried, okay?
@RazzleDazzly I like to think I'm already woke. (Did I say that right?)
@RazzleDazzly I wondered why wake up beliebers was trending and I'm just really confused.
@errantEmber Yeah, I do. [he leans in to kiss her.]
@errantEmber Yeah. You deserve it. I want to spoil you a little.
@irishwhips You're an excellent blanket.
@irishwhips And you're nice and warm.
@errantEmber Hey. I got us dinner reservations for tonight.
@irishwhips It's pretty amazing.
Crawling into bed feels so dam good.
So ready to fall into bed.
There is no way I'm going to respond to a work email at 11:30 at night are you high.
@errantEmber No. Never.
@errantEmber I'm an alcoholic. That's bad enough.
@errantEmber All I wanted to be is a father that never was like my father. And...I'm not sure I'm doing that.
I hate these meetings.
@errantEmber [he nods, twisting his hand in her shirt.] Okay.
@errantEmber [he wraps his arms around her and lays his head on her shoulder.] ...I'm not a bad dad, right?
@errantEmber He takes his soberness really seriously. It might be helpful.
@errantEmber Yeah, I do. Tony might be coming to some of them with me.
@RazzleDazzly No worries. Feel free to come next week, if you want.
@errantEmber [he leans in to kiss her cheek.] I love you too.
@RazzleDazzly Thanks, man. That does mean a lot to me. They're usually every Tuesday.
@RazzleDazzly that kind of dad.
@RazzleDazzly I went to my first meeting last week. Didn't really sleep for days, after. Mostly because I didn't realize I became --
@RazzleDazzly Y'know. I'm not going to say no.
@RazzleDazzly No, I mean, super not a big deal. I have to go to ten AA meetings. That's it.
@errantEmber Yeah, but you love me.
Forcing @errantEmber to dance with me to country songs at night is my favorite thing.
One of the kids fractured his ankle tonight. Dealing with hat was great.
@RazzleDazzly Guardrail. No one was hurt.
@RazzleDazzly I'm fine. Just a few bruised ribs. Car is going to be out of the shop tomorrow.
@RazzleDazzly I dunno. I was in a bad place, got drunk and crashed my car. It's whatever.
@RazzleDazzly I, um. Might have gotten a DUI.
@RazzleDazzly Oh, trust me, I am. But. Got some other stuff going on too. And you're my friend, of course I worry about you.
@RazzleDazzly I mean, what's going on? Is it more than just running?
@RazzleDazzly Why do things taste like blood what is going on.
@RazzleDazzly Yo, what?
Dancing around to country music with Si in the kitchen.
@errantEmber Is the car out of the shop yet?
Another meeting tomorrow. I'm fucking dreading it.
My favorite thing is gross incompetence.
@Exoplate @errantEmber She's so fucking great.
Out to lunch with @errantember and the little man. https://t.co/oynhpO3X8q
Still can't sleep.
@errantEmber Okay. That sounds good.
@errantEmber I mean, I wouldn't mind seeing you.
@errantEmber I'm assuming you're out for the day?
@errantEmber I haven't been sleeping well.
@errantEmber I'm staying home from work today.
I haven't really been able to sleep since the meeting.
@errantEmber I love you, baby.
@errantEmber [he uses her cheek, sighing as he held her close.{
@errantEmber Okay, okay. [he moves a step closer to her, placing a hand on her shoulders.] I'll go.
@errantEmber [he nods slowly, chest twisting.] Okay. I'll do it, Em. For you.
@errantEmber [he moves to rub the back of his head, frowning.]
@errantEmber I don't...it shouldn't about me.
@errantEmber I know. But. I never...never really thought of it like that.
@errantEmber I'm sorry. It was shitty of me.
@errantEmber Did...did it really?
@errantEmber I'm so not. I crashed my car. Once.
I hate this. I absolutely hate this.
@errantEmber But I'm not drunk. I'm not a danger to Si, or you.
@errantEmber But I'm not drunk.
@errantEmber And maybe I have a beer a few times a week. That's not a problem/
@errantEmber Are you honestly calling me an alcoholic? I barely drank while you were pregnant.
@errantEmber I've slowed. We have Si now. I'm not going to get drunk in front of him.
@errantEmber I don't know what you're saying, Emily.
@errantEmber What? We had a few beers at dinner. That's not a lot. And are you saying that me liking beer got you pregnant?
@errantEmber No, what? I haven't always been a heavy drinker.
@errantEmber That was one bad day. I don't have a problem, okay?
@errantEmber I mean, I don't know if good for me is the best way to describe it.
@errantEmber Okay, okay. Jesus.
@errantEmber Emily.
@errantEmber Yeah. Sure. I, uh, got put on a big job so I'm actually not sure if I can make it.
@errantEmber [he nods, running a hand through his hair.] Yeah. Right.
I don't want to fucking do this.
Shit. Today is the first AA meeting.

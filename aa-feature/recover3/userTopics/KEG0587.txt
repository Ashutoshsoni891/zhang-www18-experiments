@RyanJoyal7 my hotels next to the hall of fame, want a present?
Slowly starting to like Starbucks 
Eating in a restaurant alone is kind of depressing
I forgot what the sun feels like.
Southern hospitality and not the ludacris song
Southern accents 
Restaurants named bojangles and who you wit, I am definitely in the south
Too bad the guy next to me was married, his shoulder was very comfortable to rest my head.
This plane ride found me a new tv show, vanderpump rules
Up and away to North Carolina, Duke country 
I get so much anxiety going through security at the airport
@CatBar515 I can't make any promises!!!

@essentialq with meeee 
When a grad from Harvard asks where you went to school 
Why is packing so challenging?!
But wait I'm the only one home, does that mean I have to shovel solo?! 
Having Fridays off is starting to be a blessing
Am I wrong for thinking Kobe Bryant is still dreamy?!

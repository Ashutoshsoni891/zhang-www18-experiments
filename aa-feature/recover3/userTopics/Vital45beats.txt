\"Seems like she just gets passed around like a blunt!\"  Lol
Gotta love direct deposit!!! $$$$$$$$$$$
Get to spend the day with Dez today! Super excited!  She really knows how to cheer me up and make me happy! Got alot to talk to her about!
She said, \"I respect your feelings, and I understand how you feel, but if she denies the worth of your efforts, you have my number\"...
Never expected to feel so much for someone so quick. Better take my own advice and be careful, she might be playing me like a video game! 
I swear my sponsor is the coolest! I can talk to her for hours! She has great insight on what alcohol does to you mentally and physically!
Looking forward to another night of endless conversation over the phone tonight! She really knows how to keep a conversation going with me!
Although happiness is a feeling, is an emotion...  It is also a choice...  In order to be happy, you have to first choose to be happy!!!  
But now I can enjoy this day for all the GREEN I get to see instead!!!!!   
With that said, today will be my first St. Patricks day where I did not drink in almost ten years!  I used to drink on this day religiously!
AA meeting was pretty cool today...  Got to hear some interesting stories from the others about how alcohol affected them and their lives...
Song of the day for me!!!  Pharrell Williams - Happy http://t.co/e0rNFNSfT5
Way ahead of schedule at work so far...  Today should be an easy day! Nice and sunny out, got another AA meeting after work!  Feeling great!
Nothing like going to work on only one hour of sleep! Haha well that's what i get for talking on the phone all night! Lol #tired #work #
http://t.co/CEc9GTESMW
For real tho!!! http://t.co/Rqi5NjtXuY
AA meeting #2 down and in the books... Today I learned that there's no point in drowning your sorrows, because sorrows know how to swim!
About to head out to day two of AA, my first day was actually pretty eye opening and I must say, my eyes are wide open!  #roadtorecovery
Can't remember the last time I talked on the phone for that long!!!  #goodadvice #shesawesome #5hourconvo #thankyou #movingforward
Staying positive...

Got my first AA meeting tomorrow at 6pm!  Wish me luck everybody, I'll need all the support I can get!! http://t.co/X3qi0OsYNq
All I can do is pray...I know that if another person can't forgive me, and if I can't forgive myself, at least I know that God will... 
That's true! http://t.co/wyfVDReFpb

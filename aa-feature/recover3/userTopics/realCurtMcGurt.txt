Do what makes you happy cuz you never know when your time is up.
No one else's opinion really matters except your own. Just don't be ignorant.
Do what you think is right. Don't let someone else tell you what right and wrong is.
You have your own perception of right and wrong.
You are who you are. And I am who I am.
This is the new American Dream

@KingHarrington6 @Nazario1017 not quite. But ok.
@Johnnayyeee idk why you are so surprised. That's welding life bro.
@Nazario1017 nope
Even the shitty aspects of my life, I'm happy that they are shitty.
Fuck dude Idc. I'm happy as fuck with everything in my life. Literally everything.
Can't sleep. Gonna fake laugh at everything.
@EMoore65 still made a three tho right?
@EMoore65 and 4 when you get a foul and make a 3*
@EMoore65 @Nick13Loden not a 3pt shooter so he doesn't shoot behind the arch a lot but can sink them when it comes down to it.
@EMoore65 vintage wade bro
@Nick13Loden @EMoore65 it's in the bag bro. Dumbass.
@Nick13Loden @EMoore65 he bet against me actually
Wade gonna shoot 40% behind 3pt line this year
@rachh_lo please? :-{
Someone tie me up to a chair, naked, and put their lit cigarettes out on my body.

@H_TownRacer @urboyzach this is great. Miller is the best.
@arielleeprice it's at least better than it being a kewrs on a Miller lite coaster
Went to my first AA meeting ever today, and let me just say one thing

It sucks to be around a bunch of people who are high &amp; laughing at everything &amp; I'm over here just like 
@goodhomiecoop haha that's me  rum &amp; ginger is my favvvvvv.
@goodhomiecoop can't really do vodka but I'll drown in rum any day
@goodhomiecoop I was taking shots of jack last night &amp; was taking them like a fuckin champ somehow. I was impressed by myself hahaha
@goodhomiecoop that was the last time I had it. But it mixed with dr p sounds danke
@goodhomiecoop fireball always creates interesting nights haha. I got too fucked up off of some angry balls a few months ago. Pretty sure
@goodhomiecoop love blue moon. I've only ever liked a few of the Sam seasonals. &amp; I can only drink angry if it's mixed with fireball haha
@goodhomiecoop it's the only beer I've ever had a burning passionate hate towards really but last night I was thoroughly enjoying it
Never have enjoyed PBR either until last night. Drank it out of a bottle for the first time &amp; it was actually good.

Slowest Friday night ever
@KirstieReich wow ya that's just annoying. I've only ever experienced terrible things with amazon. So unfortunate 
@KirstieReich cause the charge was something weird then I realized what it was from but they still didn't care so I was like cool 
@KirstieReich cause when I got my first overdraft I just went to the bank bc I didn't know how it happened &amp; they refunded everything
@KirstieReich I'm sure if you call or email amazon bitching they will refund it. Also what bank?

@versacekitten outdoor cats go outside &amp; bury their shit. Which is cool. But as long as the owners house is clean the cat will be too 
@versacekitten I hate people who don't take care of their litter boxes. Like as soon as Luna poops once I immediately clean it haha.
@versacekitten I wouldn't have either hahaha.
@757TrapQueen I just realized how grammatically fucked that entire tweet was &amp; it's really botherin me but you get the point

Here a strange noise &amp; look over at Luna to discover her just licking my mattress?......
@Megevss13 seriously. This girl claimed she was sooo stressed bc she hadn't found a prom dress yet like 4 months ago...
Feeling sick to my stomach with the amount of shit on my mind.
@lalasmores my cat has killed so many bugs in my house it's awesome. But she's been stung by a wasp  &amp; she still tries to hunt them down.

Me to believe I'm something that I'm not. Don't force me into \"sobriety\" when I'm 20 years old. Like all y'all lost your kids &amp; home &amp; shut

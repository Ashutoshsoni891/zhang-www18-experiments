I love how when we equalise that late on our players don't make a song and dance about it. Back to the centre circle to try for the winner.
87 minutes. 1-0 down. Won 3-1. Still gobsmacked.
@spursycob @Craig_Spur @kev_g1 I know who I'd rather have in the side.
@Craig_Spur @kev_g1 Really don't understand the Son bashing. Proves himself time and time again.
I bet our result really twisted the tits of everyone else in the top six.
I don't even have the words....
Fuck me, what a result!!!!
I love to so much @SpursOfficial
Come ooooooonnnn!!!! @Dele_Alli
45 minutes to put this right. #COYS
@kev_g1 @Craig_Spur Agree with Craig. Proven himself over and over.
.@Annaml1988 https://t.co/k7RpSr2tYE
@SingleMaltSuds @SpursOfficial Is the correct answer.
@SingleMaltSuds Lloris up from a corner sounds nice but means the last game would probably be a draw. Got to be a Kane winner for me.
@Midlands_Greats @Tomfoins87 Who?
@stylishriot I saw them open for La Dispute last year. They were pretty good.
@WestHam_Central Terrible reception at The London Stadium. Fitting.
@LeePriv90 I think he's brilliant mate. I think he's a good centre back but a top quality DM.
@LeePriv90 Dier, Toby, Jan.
@LeePriv90 Voted 4-6 but three of them are at Spurs.
@FerrariNana11 Ok I'll fill you in. Man United just pretty much sealed not getting top four
"Too many years of hurt". - a Man United (and Chelsea) fan. https://t.co/TabxYCRG8S
Still, that should seal Man United not getting top four. Nice.
@JohnnyTheYid @grayjam68 I'm open cheeked too.
@JohnnyTheYid iPad mate.
@JohnnyTheYid I used to use StreamPlanet but they'll tweet out one dud link per game now.
I remember when there were reliable streaming accounts on Twitter.
@_1lucky @superspurs34 There were a few good episodes but mostly slow ones I fell asleep through. Negan saved this series for me.
@Sevilla_Spurs @Bateseyboy @bashstreetyid @_Ubique__ @stumpyspurs I like how he misses "The Sun understand".... makes a huge difference.
@RicheyRevol You leave my Grandad out of this.
Yes  https://t.co/935ZaKxkw1
@GaffneyVLC @CookPassTim Fortunately for them the average Sun reader wouldn't pick up on this.
@astroehlein @Tomfoins87 Cause and effect. https://t.co/xz1N3kr2TG
Cause, effect. https://t.co/nGaMilBHva
Well that wrapped up nicely. #TheWalkingDeadUK
@RicheyRevol My partner Lance does. I'm not overly fussed.
@AskPlayStation @PlayStation I just paid for three months of PlayStation Plus and you took the money from my card twice. Who do I talk to?
@AskPlayStation I just renewed my three monthly subscription to PlayStation plus and you took the money from my card twice!
@1882_nick_o_lie It's hard not to dream isn't it?
@RicheyRevol It's when you're about to penetrate another man and he guffs on your willy.
@RicheyRevol Do you know what a Warm Ronald is?
@1882_nick_o_lie No, not this season.
https://t.co/QO32UXP7ur
Arsenal have the strangest fanbase in football.
I just called Starburst "Opal Fruits". Old.
@JohnnyTheYid Watching The Green Mile. Classic.
@hurst_craig My natural instinct was to want an Arsenal loss but looking at the league table I'm happy with the draw
@Tomfoins87 @Bevlar90 @02BJT Why? Just..... why?
Great result! It would have to take some monumental Spurs style collapse for Spurs to not get top four now.
@michaelc1961 Nice
@CHLiquid @Stream_Planet Hahaha yeah. StreamPlanet used to be so good.
@Stream_Planet This one is a dud.
Hahahaha I went to school with this guy. https://t.co/aBsuJgKjQU
@sayers_14 Makes us tick.
@ErikLamela Here's to a speedy recovery.
@RicheyRevol We'll probably offer something even more offensive this season like a Sissoko straight swap.
Should have bought Zaha when everyone thought he was crap.
Best result for us today?
@Kirstb1 A City win will blow Arsenal out of the water. That's what I'm cheering for.
@Pivotal_Hotspur I saw it at the cinema when I was 12 with my Mum who cried her eyes out. I was just grateful for the tits.
#Titanic is a great film. Come @ me.
@PainInTheArse @Bateseyboy We were in with a shot last season. The title this season has been won for months though.
@CHLiquid Hahaha great stuff
@superspurs34 Sounds like something Wayne Rooney would do. Probably plays a part in him still being at the club.
@stylishriot Not yet man. Got them all downloaded and ready on my phone though
Watch to the end. Incredible. https://t.co/dugPXKF9hA
@Craig_Spur The attitude of just rolling over when things have gone to shit has just been completely wiped from the team.
@sayers_14 He has a future with us without a doubt.
2000 Trees Festival looks great!
This game seemed unsalvageable at half time. What a win. #COYS https://t.co/5RkiuEOyvi
@stylishriot @tehTrunk @Tomfoins87
Link anyone?
@Stream_Planet This is a dud too mate.
@SlapMeLow13 Same. StreamPlanet aren't what they used to be.
@superspurs34 @02BJT He's just put another up. Hopefully we'll have more joy with this. https://t.co/ZIEj1QAANH
@02BJT @superspurs34 Are these links working for you guys? I can't get more then a few seconds in before it crashes?
@Stream_Planet All dud mate. Any other links for this game?
@superspurs34 https://t.co/iRyVk9xURu
Went to put a fiver on Spurs 1-0 and accidentally put 1-0 Burnley on instead. At least I get 65 consolation if that result comes in.
Some goal that. Coutinho, bravo. #LIVEVE
https://t.co/d6fJBufuvX
@stylishriot Punk o' Rama III was the best!
@RicheyRevol I'll bet there are strings. Strings of yeast.
@SingleMaltSuds @tehTrunk @stylishriot @RichArrowsmith @Tomfoins87 Nope, your opinion on that being the worst opinion was the worst.
@tehTrunk @SingleMaltSuds @stylishriot @RichArrowsmith @Tomfoins87 I'm on team Arrows/Jim/Trunk. As funny as How I Met Your Mother.
@Sir_roozy I totally agree. I don't think he'd make our starting XI anymore but I'd love to have him as an option on the bench.
@Sir_roozy He'd still be a very, very good option from the bench.
Seems to be a theme on my timeline this morning! @_Ubique__ @AssembleTheArmy Keep up the good work! Nearly four yea https://t.co/CK2DpED8xs

@grayjam68 @Twitter Now I know you're talking to me G
@grayjam68 @Twitter Are you talking to me G? I can't tell?
@SlapMeLow13 @Twitter @SlapMeLow13 I'm manually going to put my @'s in. See? Just like old times.

@SlapMeLow13 @Twitter I suppose the extra characters are a plus but it doesn't make who's talking to who clear at all.
The new format is really shit @Twitter.
@02BJT @RicheyRevol @grayjam68 I have a great taste in men.
@Nikhil_Saglani so do I but I prefer three at the back Tottenham.
@stylishriot I've just subscribed to it. I'm on a job on my own tomorrow so that should pass the time
@stylishriot nah mate. I'll look into it x
@tamsysam79 save yourself the hassle and give the award straight to @02BJT
@spursycob @RicheyRevol @CookPassTim hey, I'm still learning ok?
@RicheyRevol @CookPassTim don't make me racist you. It's allowed now.

@lukedawson86 I can't remember the last time an original film that will go down as a classic came out.
How is it a Jumanji reboot then? https://t.co/SbgOBvISy1
@rtr_pod that's a shame.
@youryanatsix go to a game you plastic fuck.
@rtr_pod how come you don't pod as much as you used to?
@JFT13 26th April mate. Have to have a good look round the old girl before she goes :(
Tottenham stadium tour booked for next month. I've been meaning to get round to it for years.
@stylishriot @Mmords22 Jim, when you're right you're right.
@Mmords22 I'd happily eat this.
@hurst_craig NoFX for me but Strungout and Propagandhi have served me well over the years.
@baldsquire FFSSSSSSSSSS!!!!
@stylishriot obviously.
@JuiceYoda it'd be a tough choice if NoFX wasn't an option.
Favourite Fat Wreck band?

*middle of THE night.Tard.
@ParkLaneBlock40 @Bateseyboy even if Janssen was an able striker I still don't think two in the squad is enough.
@RicheyRevol I can't wait! https://t.co/CBk1vD8QpK
@RicheyRevol a striker you big thilly goose.
@Bateseyboy I'm on the fence with this one. I wouldn't be opposed but it'd hardly be an investment for the future. He can still do a job.
How has an hour made this much difference? It felt like the middle of night when my alarm went off.
@RichArrowsmith I'm on the fence with this one. Although it's no good long term he can clearly still do a job and I wouldn't be opposed.
Would you take Defoe on a one year contract as back up next season?
@02BJT @Bateseyboy I was 18 too. It really doesn't feel that long ago though.
@PaiigeTheRage obviously not.
Literally every male that isn't me is wearing a Ralph Lauren polo shirt.
@Sgt_shred1 the way they pass the egg is hilarious.
@Tomfoins87 @herbsy77 at least we have the world rowing championships.
@Tomfoins87 @herbsy77 I don't know how we manage a whole summer. I'm just going to work for three months straight I think.
@Sgt_shred1 utter shite mate. I tried getting into it when I lived over there but it's just too ridiculous to follow.
@herbsy77 @Tomfoins87 work all day yesterday and Mother's Day stuff all day today. It's been quite a well placed one for me.
Work all day yesterday, Mothers Day stuff today. This is quite a well placed international break.
@carsey2894 @riki_rikidance I've scrolled past it a few times but for some reason never pressed play. I can't stop listening to it now!

@Spursy_Gav yeah mate.
@vkon1 live fast die young.
You have to love these wild Saturday nights. https://t.co/WIzg59o1E5
@RicheyRevol no, just the one. Then maybe two takeaways for dessert.
@stylishriot and we lose an hour tonight. I may as well have not bothered leaving site.
@SlapMeLow13 @1882Marco phwoar.
Just got in from work. My weekend begins here. FML.
@BenLewis0795 I'm having my first bout today. I also had to de-ice my van this morning.
Can you kindly fuck off @work? It's Saturday.
Very, very watchable. 7.5/10

@CookPassTim @lukedawson86 haha poor use of words. Facebook is awash with racists and my friends in their thirties using kooky teenage lingo
*Logs onto Facebook for the first time in ages**Saw Tommy Robinson and @lukedawson86 using the word "sesh"**Logs off immediately*
@neilgiller @grayjam68 looks like my happy place.
@grayjam68 @neilgiller same. Today's a write off but I may have a victory tomorrow.
@grayjam68 @neilgiller I found it cause to celebrate.
@grayjam68 @neilgiller https://t.co/zRI61yGiJ4
@JamesBlunt @twentysixreds @chrisdb94 Touch Sir.
@grayjam68 the one on the left. I hope he dies.
I know I'm fat but please stop texting me @dominos
@stylishriot I was fooled too mate. He was the one I was most excited about.
@andyperry79 @sayers_14 Christ, yeah he was. He was a distant memory once Kane turned up. That Fiorentina miss defines him for us.
@andyperry79 @sayers_14 I thought he was the answer to all of our problems. I think it was about three games in when I realised the reality.
I love Harry Kane more then I love my girlfriend.
@ShannonAlli20 @piersmorgan @HKane less ridiculous then an Arsenal shirt though.
@Bateseyboy these are the bounties of kids sweets. The rank ones left in the bottom of the tub for ages before you eventually throw them out
@piersmorgan @HKane #HarrysAGooner... looks like it... https://t.co/PA9XdzyKDB
@twentysixreds thanks for the retweet. It's reassuring to know I'm not the only one who loses control over his body occasionally.
@nickzegreek just shy of 200 mate.
As I expected I was unsuccessful with my Arsenal ticket application. I recon my last trip to White Hart Lane will be Bournemouth.
@nickzegreek unsuccessful. As expected.
@HotspurRelated well that was good business.
@epic_24 @grayjam68 @SniersMoregut Toby, Wanyama, Alli, possibly Kane.
@ClareNorth @NiccybutNicey @WayneRooney I have to get up at 6am to earn 10% of his weekly wage annually. Spoilt, fat, granny shagger.
@grayjam68 @SniersMoregut going to sting all the more when Poch leaves us and takes Hugo with him.
@JFT13 mine was last year, aged 31. Wasn't ill, just totally out of the blue. I think I'm just a bit slack.
@JFT13 I hope you voted 30+ then (I think that's how old you are!?)
@spursfansimon 31 years old, perfectly well, hadn't had a drink for three years, walking down the stairs in my house.
@tamsysam79 @G_Man_Baker @Bateseyboy none of us grew out of finding poo funny. The ones that say they did are just trying to impress you.
@Bateseyboy @G_Man_Baker my friend found a bush to go behind at Reading fest and his pants hadnt cleared the drop zone so he still shat them
@G_Man_Baker @Bateseyboy my friend has left countless pairs of soiled boxers in pub toilet cisterns after weekend long MDMA sessions.
@G_Man_Baker more then a table spoon of actual shit in your pants mate.
Twitter is being very honest. Good for you guys. Now go to the toilet.
@SlapMeLow13 @Wayno_Mi11er the rule is that it has to be more then a tablespoon full.
@TheTottenhamWay @Tomfoins87 @Dan_KP @adamdnathan great pod guys. Dan still needs to speak up!
@grayjam68 @Bateseyboy @twentysixreds just book me in for a Sir Cliff.
@grayjam68 @Bateseyboy @twentysixreds please do. Ill feelings between myself and a loved one tends to make me shit myself.
@grayjam68 @Bateseyboy @twentysixreds I'm sorry Graham but the excitement of being spoilt was too much.
@Bateseyboy @twentysixreds that happened to my "friend" recently too and my "friend" is nearly four years sober.
@RicheyRevol I've never identified with a sentence quite like I did with "my asshole is like the wasteband on a pair of old pyjama bottoms".
@RicheyRevol I heard a term for that the other day. When you just need a general wipe you're feeling "swooey".
@RicheyRevol to be fair I've ticked each of these options on more then one occasion.
@Sgt_shred1 has to be more then a tablespoon full.
@twentysixreds happens to the best of us mate. Some more regularly then others (me).
How old were you when you last crapped your pants?
@JRHartley1 @RicheyRevol pssst, the correct answer is Sonic.
@RicheyRevol I can always relate to your poetry.
@OptaDyanmic played left wing mate.
@sayers_14 so he'd be third in line for that spot behind Dembele and Winks?
@lukedawson86 follow more interesting people then. Mines a hoot.
Hotmail is down again. Brilliant.
Hotmail is down again. Brilliant.
@spursycob yeah, my iPhone keeps harassing me for my password and I can't log in. Happened about two weeks ago too.
@SlapMeLow13 Philadelphia. Oh dear.
@_1lucky bullshit!
@02BJT @SingleMaltSuds very wise. Don't lower your guard until the final whistle of the final game.
@02BJT that season taught me a valuable lesson to not open my mouth until the season is over. That lesson served me well last year.
@LiquidSpurs @tehTrunk they'll plummet to sixth or seventh place for a few seasons a la Man United that's for sure.
@tehTrunk totally agree. I can't wait for him to go so they can actually taste mediocrity.
@gamray knowing what to do when you lose your virginity must be a confusing experience now.

@pokeefe1 @todareistocoys @CookPassTim fair call.
@shelleyj89 @RichArrowsmith probably best not.
@RichArrowsmith @shelleyj89 #RichieWhoHasToGetUpAtSixAM does not.

@TomSuity I don't think that affects the top four's CL spots anymore.
@TomSuity I think we'll both get top four this season. United and Arsenal missing out.
@TomSuity as a Spurs fan it's exactly what I wanted
@Bevlar90 I wonder how we're going to throw away this nine point lead over Arsenal?! Lol lol loledy lol lol xxx
@Bevlar90 brilliant isn't it?
That'll do nicely. #MCILIV
What in the name of all that is holy?! https://t.co/l7XxiBbvdQ
@HKane awful being a Spurs supporter isn't it?
@Bateseyboy we make it a fortress during our final season there.

Correct. https://t.co/b7yaiJkpDN
@grayjam68 I saw he hadn't tweeted in a few months but now I've seen his account has been deleted. Shame, nice guy.
What ever happened to Tottenham Tobe? My timeline has a distinct lack of swearing.
@kingjeb to it this morning* Tard.
@kingjeb thanks mate. My attention got drawn too but this morning because it got a retweet even though it's not relevant anymore.
Son for me. He bangs them in for fun against teams outside of the top six. Give Janssen half hour if the game is won by then.
Who should start up top today?
@AuntyBoon @SingleMaltSuds @stylishriot so it's a Yorkshire Pudding Sandwich followed by Yorkshire Pudding profiteroles for Sunday lunch.
@stylishriot @SingleMaltSuds @AuntyBoon would give that a go.
@RicheyRevol I thought it seemed light.
@SingleMaltSuds cheers bro.
@Bevlar90 my heart says Janssen but my head says Son.
Still can't believe the numbers this got... https://t.co/zrjd8IokI2

@SkySportsNewsHQ @nad_THFC what a partnership that was!

@Craig_Spur @heyitschar__ I can definitely see the appeal of staying out there but it just didn't ever feel like home to me.
@Bateseyboy @RicheyRevol @MrOKanenas my problem is by the time I've got to the school I've eaten all the haribo. #fatnonceproblems
@lukedawson86 there is that.
@Craig_Spur @heyitschar__ everyone asks that. Loved the first few months but after the first year I really started to miss home.
@hatspur that's how it'd go.
Lived there once. Prefer England tbh... https://t.co/uaSUxIDwZN
@False_CB he just so obviously is. It's going to sting like a bitch when he leaves us.
I hate the away goal rule.
@lukedawson86 I didn't get round to watching it. I have it downloaded though.
@RicheyRevol @CHLiquid @riki_rikidance no yeast, no party.
@RicheyRevol @riki_rikidance would work on me.

@RichArrowsmith haha I gave this some thought earlier. Literally none!
@lukedawson86 pop to KFC on your way over then.
@grayjam68 fantastic work G.
@rapharris_ @nickzegreek I just did mate. Brilliant stuff, that's hopefully the first of many.
@02BJT @RicheyRevol I thought you said nice guys finish last Bobby? You sir, sound like a gentleman.
@Craig_Spur hopefully this gives him the confidence for more but as much as I want it to work out a goal against Millwall doesn't say much.
I love Vincent Janssen. How humble he was when he scored, how he consoled their keeper after the sixth went in. Nice guy.
@RicheyRevol you like yours rare?
Norovirus on steak and blowjob day.
@Tomfoins87 incredible work sir.
@spursycob oh what Wembley? That place we have consistent results?
@RicheyRevol and the answer?
@RicheyRevol I didn't know either of these things?! That isn't a benchmark of it not being common knowledge though.
@Craig_Spur @eralcluap so would I. Plus the few weeks off work would be nice.
Would you sacrifice your ankle for Harry Kane's?
@shelleyj89 @JamieCHumphreys @vincentjanssen the crowd do too. They were all behind him yesterday and he got the biggest cheer.
@Sgt_shred1 chin up mate. Just keep going!
@shelleyj89 @JamieCHumphreys @vincentjanssen word has it he's the nicest guy at the club. I hope it works out for him here.
@LeeGallows he's young and from a naff league. He always needed time to find his feet but confidence became a factor too. I'm glad he scored
6-0 against the scummiest team in English football for our last FA Cup game at White Hart Lane. Beautiful.
@LeeGallows I can't help but feel if VJ had scored that saved shot against Everton on the first game he'd be having a very different season.
@LeeGallows looked bad mate. Luckily Son puts them away for fun against teams outside of the top six and we have an easy(ish) run for a bit.
@rapharris_ good mate thanks. There was a traveller christening next door so I was touching cloth slightly.
And for my next trick I'll instantly turn this Friday afternoon into a Monday morning...
@grayjam68 where I'm headed!
@Jake_Rockett 2008 wants its tweet back.
Just invented the best sandwich. Ham, cheese, pepper, cheese and chive dip, sea salt and balsamic vinegar crisps.
@Pauld7thfc the same reason I say thank you to cash machines.
@RicheyRevol they threw them anyway.
@josh_creator yeah they're scum mate but if you're going to goad several Millwall fans after a battering you'll get chinned eventually.
@josh_creator what did he expect? Millwall are proper.
Obviously not on but the law of averages says he'd get chinned eventually. This wasn't Arsenal, it was Millwall. https://t.co/7oR2657F8s
Well taken. That's the floodgates open. Brilliant @vincentjanssen #COYS
@AnthonyHufton @MirrorDarren nah mate, being racist isn't appalling at all.
@PhatPoch no way. That'll be the match he returns for and he'll bang a hat-trick.
Fantastic goal. #COYS
@gloryglorytott absolutely spot on. With everyone fit we're the best in the league. Take one of them away and we're no where near.
@SpursOfficial @HKane @ChrisEriksen8 *googles least painful suicide methods*
@SpursOfficial should do the job nicely.
@AgsConnolly @RicheyRevol beat me to it. Happy Gilmore, 1996.
@stylishriot we played with Evil Hour who are like Tsunami Bomb but last week we managed to get a support slot on Trash Talk's UK tour
@stylishriot there was some fighting but our set went off without a hitch!
@Bateseyboy two of them games are at Wembley too. Easy.
#COYS Three wins away from silverware. We can do this.
I played a hardcore punk gig in the room next door to a traveller christening last night and some of you are scared of Millwall?

I hope Wenger goes. Their fanbase will really be in for a shock when they're not consistently getting top four and the occasional trophy.
@herbsy77 same here, but the guy in the video didn't seem like Mr Giggles.
@herbsy77 I'd love to have seen the blazing row afterwards.

@RichArrowsmith "Tottenham fans are gay". Brilliant.
@_Ubique__ @Bucks_PT @DerekBlackSpurs @spursycob what a lad.
This has been retweeted to death but here it is again. Hysterical. https://t.co/pjsvPCRBhz
@_Ubique__ @Bucks_PT @DerekBlackSpurs @spursycob amazing how a bit of money and fame can make even the most cringeworthy of people desirable
@spursycob failed as a footballer, trying to make it as a celebrity "lad". Being cheeky Nando's when you're in your thirties is tragic.
@stokecity @ManCity you were the real winners with this wonderful Twitter work this evening.
@stylishriot https://t.co/SGzWKcSlkL
I wish it was the nineties. Space - Me And You Versus The World https://t.co/26lEk61c3u
@GaryPaxo @adamdnathan god I hate that grinch looking racist.
Tottenham 4 - 1 Millwall. You heard it here first.
@Independent this picture makes no sense? Who watches porn with a free hand?
@Tomfoins87 he's not great but he'd be in the starting XI of more then half of PL teams. We won't do better on our wage structure.
@Tomfoins87 @stylishriot @Tweetgood_Mac this is true. If Spurs don't play that day I'll watch the episode.
@stylishriot @Tomfoins87 @Tweetgood_Mac Peep Show is also a contender for me.
@stylishriot @Tomfoins87 @Tweetgood_Mac over the years I've missed A LOT of episodes. Should do a poll Tom.
@Tomfoins87 @Tweetgood_Mac Friends is my winner without a doubt. I won't watch MOTD if it's a Spurs loss so that rules out a lot of episodes
@hatspur we won't get better that's willing to sit on the bench on our wage structure.
@SpursOfficial @Ben_Davies33 good stuff! Would walk into most PL starting XIs. We wouldn't get a better backup LB.
@josh_creator he's an amazing talent. Shame he'll mostly be remembered for biting people and cheating.
@WhiteHartKane what should really be the focus of last night's football. Fuck Barca, we're still second!
@joshuapsjones @josh_creator *cheater.
@twentysixreds the anglia training centre. Cheers man, it's bloody tough.
Is there such a thing as enough sleep?
Insane comeback, still speechless. #barcapsg
See?
I have no doubt Barcelona will turn this round.
@RicheyRevol @CHLiquid banned mate. Them bloody gerbils and their tell-tale eyes.
@CHLiquid I'm gauging the people of Essex by reality television so yes, I think they're all cunts.
If I had the chance to drop a bomb on the house of every single Ex on the Beach contestant I wouldn't hesitate.
So I'm now a bonified, certified gas engineer.
@sayers_14 we'll still finish below those bastards. This is their cue to surge up the table.
@_1lucky happy birthday bro x
@WestHam_Central Astra go-go.
@WestHam_Central to be fair mate, we actually qualified for two European cups this season.
I'd like him to go too. Then we'll get to see Arsenal fans without top four year in year out and a trophy every few https://t.co/jTg1Ijf9jh
@ZeroFilterGuy @CharlesM966 @spursshow https://t.co/ipXd0S2sRR
@TheloniousFilth @tehTrunk nailed on.
@SportsJOE_UK @Bateseyboy this is glorious.
@sayers_14 they get humiliated in Europe then surge up the Premier League table. As sure as the day will turn into night.
@Bucks_PT @Bateseyboy yeah, he's nailed on to score against Arsenal every time. The only "big team" he hasn't scored against is Man United.
@Bateseyboy I've only heard it ironically for a while now. His class is undeniable now surely?
Pssst. I don't think anyone has called Harry Kane a fraud, tap in merchant, penalty merchant or a one season wonder for a while now.
@Thehotstepperxo @taammiiM it's why I don't bother with Facebook anymore. Twitter is where you can really let rip.
@taammiiM @Thehotstepperxo haha this is fucking amazing.
@HotspurRelated I can smell bullshit on this one.
@Independent Jesus Christ. That's horrific.
@StGeorgeofTuf @Pauld7thfc I'm sorry to hear that
@02BJT @_AndyHa didn't the striker of the team this guy supports prance around like a fairy to celebrate a draw at Bournemouth?
@colinwright1959 @spursycob I voted Jan. What's the answer?
The Queers - Fuck This World https://t.co/ernhIJ54Yv
@shelleyj89 just looked at my timehop  https://t.co/7hyHNvMKwf
@shelleyj89
@whatfamm it's mostly Arsenal fans who seem to have forgotten Giroud prancing around to celebrate a draw against Bournemouth.
@Bateseyboy needing a point against an already relegated team and blowing it by a four goal margin sums it up.
@Bateseyboy last season was solid proof that it just can't happen.
@HKane @MajesticMousa don't ever leave me.
@SpursOfficial @HKane @Dele_Alli @premierleague I love you.
@stylishriot https://t.co/CfF2SwWfVk
Oh no.
I love the attacking Jan Vertonghen.
@Evertxn I probably should have waited until we had the game won until I retweeted this.
@AdamCimmering even more embarrassing then that mate.
Someone asked us to sign one of our CDs at the gig last night. I've never felt more embarrassed.
@Sgt_shred1 awful band. They're a soft cock bore-fest.
Bar Rose that's our strongest team. #COYS https://t.co/DTp9EQeTSE
@achrisoulla_ @WelhamOfficial good stuff! Hopefully the others are in too. I don't fancy a CB pairing of Wimmer and Dier vs Lukaku.
Only twelve minutes until we find out Jan, Toby and Kane are all out injured.
What do people like about You Me At Six? Utter shite.
@RicheyRevol more a Freddy Mercury backstage.
Banging gig tonight
@Tomfoins87 you're not a sci-if guy are you? Wasn't it you who didn't see Star Wars until his late twenties?
@grayjam68 no, they're the only lyrics in an entire 11 minute song.
I need to stop going to the kebab shop before playing a hardcore punk set.
A draw would have suited us better but I'll never not enjoy an Arsenal loss.
@02BJT nice
Leicester aren't going to get relegated are they?
@DHarley1984 @shelleyj89 @YouTube he's also utterly, completely, stone-cold Negan.
@shelleyj89 https://t.co/egYJ5hS0r2
@shelleyj89 I work onsite where there's constantly a radio playing. I must hear it six or seven times a day. I didn't mind it at first.
@shelleyj89 quite a cool video but boy is this song overplayed now.
@lukedawson86 they're one of them bands I like but I'm not overly fussed about. Looking forward to Strike Anywhere!
@utdcentre @Deckymch @ManUtd Wrey. https://t.co/AXimcVFQRm
@utdcentre @Deckymch @ManUtd still sixth.
Imagine not going to my gig tonight... https://t.co/hcj5hgQp0P
@Tomfoins87 are you going on holiday this year then mate? Busy at work? What team do you support?
@riki_rikidance @Bateseyboy @gamray I didn't see the spat but that's incredibly decent of you to apologise. Twitter needs more of this.
@Bateseyboy next I'll be thinking computer games are for kids and Brexit is a good thing...
@Bateseyboy I'm a Lamela fan and even I'm starting to lose patience.
@lukedawson86 what did you think? I really enjoyed it. 7.5/10.
@SpursOfficial @ErikLamela who?
@PaiigeTheRage grow up.
@PaiigeTheRage yeah but the best part is Doritos for breakfast.
@lukedawson86 @RicheyRevol im not sure if that was hilarious or if the mushrooms made it so. Were we at Leeds or Reading that year?
@Bevlar90 teetotal mate. Inactivity is my drug.
#NowWatching Captain Phillips
@Bevlar90 sofa.
@lukedawson86 yeah, I'm at my most comfortable in a pair of 3/4 lengths and a tshirt. What is fashion though? Copying the next person.
@lukedawson86 oh right, I dunno. I just googled skinny jeans and Grandad's shoes.
@Ilovethejockeyc @KeefsLoveChild there's more to this then meets the eye. Quality player but clearly a big bag of issues.
@lukedawson86 I don't know what the little twats are wearing.
I like Lamela but this is getting silly. https://t.co/Gl7JmBKK6c
@RicheyRevol I was 10 years old and I had that kit. It's ugly as fuck but I wore it everywhere.
This is a fantastic watch. https://t.co/PRMcNC64sZ
@Ben_Rosenthal I wish @SpursOfficial would tweet like this.
Paul Whitehouse's highlight of the North London Derby that year. https://t.co/MnMMAdD6by
@HotspurLane fuck 'em. He's bound by contract. Dig your heals in Levy.
@sayers_14 I'd always get a Leeds ticket when Reading had sold out. The line up now is terrible. This was peak Reading/Leeds and was 95.
@sayers_14 was there mate (or possibly at Leeds.) I was an annual attendee for years. These festivals used to be so good.
@SuperRupes standard footwear and jeans mate. Look at how offensive this monstrosity is... https://t.co/plm7Euv2dL
@Vxb1 but what is fashion? Copying the next person no matter how ridiculous they look. The person at the top is probably taking the piss.
@RicheyRevol how else would I look rad?
@RicheyRevol it nearly hits the ankle of my Bolt jeans.
@RicheyRevol at 14 I dressed like Blink 182, still do. Which is now so uncool even Blink 182 don't dress like Blink 182.
Now I've never been one for fashion but at what point did it become cool to wear your sister's jeans with your Grandad's shoes?
How To Prepare For Second Puberty https://t.co/I4pczBiWjQ
@RicheyRevol @Bateseyboy snowflake.
@riki_rikidance I can't read the article, the headline itself has made me feel ill. Whatever punishment he gets is too good for this cunt.
@RicheyRevol ...and a little Lady. Good idea for a sequel.
@RicheyRevol I share my birthday with that kid Shai Labeouf gets all noncey with in that Sia video. Oh, and Giroud.
i.e. Level the fuck up Spurs or he's off. https://t.co/FIQu5lmRTY
@twentysixreds to sit in, The Spice Inn. To take away, a banquet from The Bombay Brasserie.
@CHLiquid @RicheyRevol hes watching Mars Attacks! I love that movie! https://t.co/jRKNdOnZif
 https://t.co/IdNHmlhz4D
@CHLiquid @RicheyRevol the amount of times I did that with a YouTube video or something before and thought "one day that'll be porn"...
@RicheyRevol forgot to disconnect my Bluetooth speakers then went upstairs and watched porn while my Mrs and speakers were downstairs once.
@RicheyRevol I'm not kidding anyone, still would have even during this period.
@tehTrunk no, but Jan has looked more the 2012/13 player we signed. He's better when he's free to go further forward which he can do in 343.
@Craig_Spur @tamsysam79 when I was about a year sober I didn't see the point in getting clean to kill myself with cigarettes so I just quit.
This joke format isn't funny. But this is the exception. https://t.co/92fovfmcup
@tamsysam79 I've been quit a while now but they didn't used to have any effect on me. You'd see them so often you'd become desensitised.
@RicheyRevol don't think much of yours mate. https://t.co/OFkIkmyUcH
@02BJT @RicheyRevol agreed
Hey, @LFC! https://t.co/9EbH7VVVNp
@lukedawson86 @markhoppus 1. Empire2. New Hope3. Jedi4. Force Awakens5. Rouge one6. Sith 7. Phantom Menace8. Clones
@lukedawson86 @markhoppus it was definitely the best of a bad bunch.
@lukedawson86 @markhoppus I thought I liked it on release but it hasnt stood the test of time. Ridiculous dialogue and OTT, unnecessary CGI.
@Sgt_shred1 a good man who's willing to do bad things to protect the people he cares about.
@markhoppus @lukedawson86 pretend Episodes I-III don't exist and there is suddenly the perfect amount.
@Bateseyboy indirecting most people I've worked on site with.
"I don't mind gays as long as they don't try nothing."- Ugly straight guys.
@lukedawson86 don't worry, it'll happen again.
@gbacon85 I just have. It hasn't achieved anything.
What's the step up from blocking someone? https://t.co/qwhkQEsZFZ
@CHLiquid @colinwright1959 https://t.co/EoWwKoRqi6
Are pancake tits as delicious as they sound?
@CHLiquid it's thrown around too loosely. Genuine racists can scoff at the word now.
@CHLiquid yeah, we'll go with that.
"I'm not a racist" says former KKK member... https://t.co/LqFB4Fckcy
Liverpool returning to their default form yesterday. Can someone explain to me why we can't we beat them?
@EE I know it's a bit much to ask but I like mine with some 4G.
@1882Marco @RicheyRevol I've gone as the child snatcher.
@RicheyRevol haha was doing exactly the same yesterday.
@baldsquire live life in pj bottoms.
@Bevlar90 if you like it you like it mate! I've just never met a Coldplay fan!
@AnthonyAshton1 agree, both bands have all the ingredients to be belting but somehow both end up sounding like dogshit.
@FerrariNana11 @colinwright1959 love them.
@FerrariNana11 @colinwright1959 love them.
@AnthonyAshton1 I hate Coldplay more then I hate U2 tbf. The top of my shit list for rock bands has to be Muse though.
@colinwright1959 never been a fan of either mate. Although my favourite all time band is The Cure and I've had it argued they're dull AF.
@colinwright1959 were either ever on the boil album wise? Every song I've ever heard by either of them has been boring as hell.
Do people who like U2 or Coldplay exist? I've never met any.
@mfcfrankos no but the majority of young people are right little chodes these days. Think they're "lads" while wearing their sister's jeans.
@mfcfrankos Reading and Leeds heading the same way.
@colinwright1959 @Spotify brilliant song. They did Zombies too didn't they?
@Bevlar90 bit from Column A, bit from Column B.
@grayjam68 @YouTube one of the greatest songs of all time.
Johnny Cash - Hurt https://t.co/8QdNGnXOLG
@jlaybs this is fantastic.
@baldsquire @stylishriot hermaphroditic porn. https://t.co/4NflWOXHXW
@baldsquire @stylishriot this is right up my street. When I'm watching real porn I'm just thinking of Bambi anyway.
@bashstreetyid the worst type of "fans", the ones who don't realise to be a supporter you actually go and support your team.
@stylishriot @baldsquire this guy is EXACTLY who should photoshop.
@bashstreetyid hate them. Know so many United "supporters" who never go to games and have nothing to do with the club but give it the biggun
@bashstreetyid agree, I like to see Southampton fail but would have preferred a United loss.
@bashstreetyid so were United.
@spurs_sel brilliant.
@spurs_sel hobbling? Crutches? Is he well?
@Jee_rad can he? I've not heard him.
@Jee_rad he looks and horrible as he is.
@_1lucky https://t.co/lfaWVzyLEV
@Jee_rad bit above all that I'd rather have seen him go full Lineker and shit himself on the field.
@youryanatsix yes, brilliant first 45. Dull as hell second 45.
@Jee_rad that'd be more satisfying then another goal.
4-5 incoming.
When we beat teams, Christ do we beat them.
#COYS
@shane87654 @COYS1986 oh dear. Written in the stars then...
If I ever worked for myself full time I'd just lay in bed all day. I'm always at least two hours late for my cash jobs at weekends.
@COYS1986 barely gets a game these days let alone scores. Nailed on to hammer one home today then...
Happy Coysday.
@colinwright1959 yes. Thick as pig shit and from what I can tell a perfect match for Jamie O'Hara.
@pokeefe1 tbf, he was never going to get famous for his footballing abilities.
@pokeefe1 he's a cringeworthy dickhead. The blokes in his thirties and wants to make it as a celebrity "lad".
@gbacon85 @stylishriot maybe you should go out with the freak.
@stylishriot https://t.co/3NpeSH5E7A
@stylishriot "So you can look me in the eye and say you had no influence whatsoever"*looks away*
 https://t.co/6qqcv6BeKu
@stylishriot we've gone out for lunch and she's just had the barbecue chicken with no barbecue sauce. So.. chicken.
@hatspur @Stranger_Things happy birthday. I'm jealous.
@FerrariNana11 ask @RicheyRevol
@Bevlar90 @UberFacts the last season was incredible.
@UberFacts yes! @Bevlar90
A short cartoon depicting what addiction is like. https://t.co/ttAZsfDSx7
@spursycob @Bevlar90 that poor Man United performance is the only argument I've ever heard.
@spursycob @Bevlar90 I'm gutted mate.
@spursycob https://t.co/MR34dtiTvC
@RicheyRevol two weeks apart and you still known me so well.
@sayers_14 yeah, with a squad this thin he needs to pick and chose who he's ruthless with for now. It didn't matter when it was Townsend.
@sayers_14 he must have crossed Poch. There's no way he'd have been behind Tom Carroll in the pecking order otherwise.
@RicheyRevol welcome back. You popping up in my mentions has given me a docker's thumb in my pants.
@WestHam_Central I don't know why some Spurs fans say that. You're my third favourite team to beat after Arsenal and Chelsea.
@stylishriot bit far mate.
@stylishriot I don't mean to laugh at other people's misfortune but this is some pretty funny misfortune.
https://t.co/pMe3wuB2nL
@stylishriot think how I feel. I saw this carnage live.
@Bevlar90 @sayers_14 those CM options
@sayers_14 Winks looks like a brilliant prospect but I still find it bizarre to have got rid of Bentaleb. Fanatic player imo.
@spursycob @G_Man_Baker @WelshSpur07 quality player. Poch dropped the ball on this one.
@nabilbentaleb42 bizarre to see you sold. Genuinely gutted. Good luck.
@hurst_craig she doesn't like any sauce and has only gotten on to gravy since I've been with her. Fucking oddball.
@bxstock think how upset I was, I saw it live.
@DHarley1984 preaching to the choir mate.
@Tomfoins87 that's her beverage.
@Tomfoins87 Weird. As. Shit.
@stu_evans @84spurs84 I would but she's much more attractive then I am.
@84spurs84 yes that is plain rice and popadoms mate!
@WelhamOfficial fussiest eater I've ever met mate. It's bizarre.
And look what my weird fucking girlfriend ordered. https://t.co/0Klz6uzRRC

@stylishriot @YouTube no worries mate. Haven't listen to this in ages so it's inspired me to put it on xxx
@stylishriot The June Spirit - Testing Superstition https://t.co/s3VmTXjWeR
@Craig_Spur I'm going to see how long I can keep the stretch going.
Had an Indian for dinner last night. Had an Indian for lunch. Gonna order the fuck out of an Indian tonight.
@OlyLister it's too soon for jokes
@SpursOfficial you've had as a really on form couple of days haven't you? Fucking pricks.
@RicheyRevol come back, you were the inspiration behind me joining Twitter.
@lukedawson86 yep, 2012. It's steadily declined ever since.
@stylishriot @SingleMaltSuds I don't know if this is the gas talking but brain meat sounds delicious.
@SingleMaltSuds safe as houses mate. Just not houses I'm installing gas into.
Day 2 of my Gas Safe Course and my head is fried. I'm also quite likely to kill all of you.
@SpursOfficial and thank you for a brilliant result.
@Sgt_shred1 @SlapMeLow13 so, so bad. I used to be an annual attendee up until 2012.
@brnurse @stylishriot @SingleMaltSuds The Lock Up Stage was where it was at although there was something good on every stage. This is toilet
RIP Reading and Leeds. https://t.co/xaT4fazWYb
@SingleMaltSuds it served me well. It reminded me that going to bed a Spurs fan tonight isn't the worst thing in the world.
@lazythfc @TheJamesForster I know they're renowned for their delusion but Jesus Christ.
@SingleMaltSuds complete bollocks mate.
@84spurs84 to be fair though.. so far... he's right!
Try finishing above us then? https://t.co/n9IMK34Koa
@Brady6ronan @Kloppholic here's an idea. Try finishing above us?
@SpursOfficial you total and utter embarrassment.
So we'll just have to settle for top four and the FA Cup then?
@Independent @indy100 coincidently so is ketamine use.
#COYS
@Sgt_shred1 it is, but it's totally undeserved. Leicester are about where they should be but he fluked the league last season.
Harsh. https://t.co/ZjeJ63mSU0
@LonMaurice I judge someone as a complete retard when I see them write "should of" or "could of".
Gutted to miss @ToucheAmore tonight because of this stupid storm. See you guys at Download Paris in June!

@CHLiquid my life goals are to have your hair all over my face. Any hair, doesn't matter what sort.
@JamesTaylorAG pwoar, just my type.
I can't wait for this beard fashion to go away because:A. They look stupid, B. They don't look stupid, I'm just bitter I can't grow one.
Thanks for sharing your TimeHop photos. It's nice to see what you all actually look like under your beards.
@lukedawson86 yeah mate, I'm disappointed but was gutted to let you down. There was no way I could risk missing my course tomorrow.
Scratch that. Fucking trains/weather.
@mfc_ben @ArryYid it's all bollocks mate. The vast majority of fans just want to see a good FA Cup tie.
@herbsy77 I try and read some NA literature every day. I generally measure the success of a day by how early I can get in my PJ bottoms.
@herbsy77 so would I. I've had my hell raiser years, they've really made me appreciate sitting down and doing nothing.
@herbsy77 the box set generation. I love it.
Fuck work tomorrow. I'm going to go to London and watch @ToucheAmore instead! Yeah!
@merchantofshite I had to listen to that while on a muddy building site in heavy rain a few days ago. Prick.
@neilgiller @Laloulabelle same here. Hard to imagine that 40% of us just throw minutes of the day away like that.
@voodoochopstiks @ManCity I had updates coming through on my phone, it sounded like an absolute belter of a game.
Boy I wish I'd stayed in and watched this tonight. https://t.co/d56BFhLQb0
I'm sure I've heard something like this before... https://t.co/n3BmphyI9m
@paulnuttallukip do you expect the morons who voted Brexit to fall for that twice? To be fair, they probably will.
@PainInTheArse none of the ArsenalFanTV lot seem mentally well but Troopz is the most cringeworthy in your fan base.
@02BJT @sayers_14 @stylishriot I agree. I hope it isn't an anticlimax. And haha, Jim's stuck in a TWD thread now.
@02BJT @sayers_14 yep, never happened in previous series. There's been a few episodes of absolute brilliance but it's generally quite slow.
@02BJT @sayers_14 I fell asleep about half hour into it so need to see it again. I thought it felt a bit slow tbf.
@02BJT haha. What did you make of The Walking Dead last night?
@02BJT it's too much for me too mate. I've settled on it being Tuesday.
As this is a two day week for me today is both my Monday and my Thursday.
@MattISpurs when I do pick my phone up it's more out of habit then actually wanting to look at Twitter.
@kev_g1 good. I've been picking my guitar up more then my phone recently. I'd much rather that.
I've really felt like I can't be arsed with Twitter recently. Hopefully this is the beginning of me not constantly staring at my phone.
@Surgeon_Mc pays for itself mate!
@_1lucky @FerrariNana11 @colinwright1959 @grayjam68 @Stott44 @_Peter_1980 @CookPassTim we don't want him thanks.
Day one of my Gas Safe course and my brain is fried.
@CookPassTim @Jake_Rockett @PokemonGoApp @whatfamm got all of those bar the Kingdra.
@twentysixreds @YouTube uncanny isn't it? Except my garage looks nothing like that.
@twentysixreds the Met Police will be getting the overtime hours in that week.
@WestHam_Central come on. Pick one. Imagine your life depends on it.
@grayjam68 @kev_g1 yeah that's pretty fucking jammy.
What date is the next round being played? #FACup
@WestHam_Central as a West Ham fan if you had to pick one of these team to go on and win, who would it be?
@grayjam68 @kev_g1 as is tradition. To be fair though, we've had an unusually kind run so far.
Exactly the draw I wanted #COYS
Millwall at home. Fucking yes!
If we avoid any of the big teams it'll be a miracle.#FACupDraw
@kev_g1 I thought we'd fuck it up. We looked so calm at the back with Vertonghen back.

@rapharris_ I don't know but hopefully it's not something that is going to come back to haunt us.
@02BJT @Laloulabelle should bang.
@AnthonyAshton1 @superspurs34 there are some dicks of here but I tend to adopt the don't follow or interact with them approach.
@merchantofshite brilliant. Since I gave up drinking food is my vice!
@AnthonyAshton1 @superspurs34 that's the spirit. Life is full of drama and bickering. What's the point of this if it's not escapism?
@spursycob @Bateseyboy @Huk06 @rafvdvaart agree. Also even a VDV who could only play for 45 minutes would have been useful.
@hurst_craig hahahahahahahaha!
A scroll through @rafvdvaart's timeline and you can see he's Spurs as fuck. Why did he have to leave when he did?
Torture. https://t.co/4LTj8ubuIK
@superspurs34 it's usually the 40+ year olds.

@gbacon85 get involved mate!
@merchantofshite I can't wait man! The line up looks great. Although the beers don't interest me, teetotal!
@Sgt_shred1 they're great live. Seen em a few times. I'm seeing Touch Amore on Thursday!
@CHLiquid my Mrs has just dropped the bombshell that we're round her mates for dinner at 12:30. I dont care how rude eating and running is..
@RickyTFC @vkon1 still Chelsea, Arsenal, Man City, Man United though.
Will I need a visa to go to France in June? Have them bloody xenophobic rascals ruined everything yet?
Just booked my ticket for Download Paris
Hahahaha bravo @LincolnCity_FC
@kev_g1 @Craig_Spur I have a horrible feeling they'll sneak it.
@Craig_Spur I don't feel good going into this one.
@Mmords22 I have the same take on brown envelopes that come through my door.
@georgebann yeah but if they can change it for the second and third shirts you could argue they can change it for this.
@georgebann sexy, although I still don't understand why we can't have a blue AIA.
@Mmords22 my email inbox is the only aspect of my life where I have my shit together.
@HazSpur92 @BenPearceSpurs he was a better all round player but couldn't score which was exactly what we signed him for. VJ offers nothing.
@HazSpur92 @BenPearceSpurs Soldado a worse signing because he was a proven goalscorer when he came to us. VJ a gamble that hasn't paid off.
@HazSpur92 @BenPearceSpurs I'm starting to agree. He just doesn't make the cut. At the very least a loan to a PL side.
@KeefsLoveChild turns out we were wrong. Tomorrow, 2pm, BBC One :)
I thought we were an untelevised 3pm Saturday kick off all week. Result!
@CookPassTim @Jake_Rockett @PokemonGoApp @whatfamm any of you know a decent tracker app for iPhone?
@grayjam68 always two steps ahead you are G. Not just a hat rack my friend.
@CookPassTim @Jake_Rockett @PokemonGoApp @whatfamm I've done it! Cheers man!
@CookPassTim @Jake_Rockett @PokemonGoApp @whatfamm how do you evolve Eevee's into the new evolutions? Tried a few and just got the old ones.
@PokemonGoApp I only just got my life back. Here we go again @Jake_Rockett @CookPassTim @whatfamm
@grayjam68 oh you big silly. Someone's getting constipated.
@vkon1 generally speaking, yes.
@Bateseyboy well we sure showed you last time.
@Asterweireld @YouTube I'm sorry. I was hoping once I passed the curse onto someone else it'd lift it for me. It hasn't.
@Bateseyboy unfortunately.
Fun Friday fact! In America it's uncommon to not be circumcised and they call willies with foreskins anteaters!
@Asterweireld this is now relevant again isn't it? https://t.co/W58bhbS6KR
So I hear Generation 2 is out now? Don't make me start playing #PokemonGO again, I'm 32.
@Annaml1988 don't make me do a Twitter poll xxx
Only just got in after working 15 hours. Glad I didn't watch the game.
@SpursOfficial this is exactly why I didn't text my Arsenal mates last night.
@jawshuewar agreed.
#COYS
@jawshuewar he should just play the youth team for every game if that's his intentions.
All for playing a strong team in the Europa as long as Pochettino doesn't throw the tournament when we hit strong opposition a la last year.
 https://t.co/wLrdWf05qr
@SchrodngrsTaint no, just rubbish mate.
@Annaml1988 this was the better one. You should go back to this xxx
@Bateseyboy @MattOftheSpurs disagree. Soldado will come good.
@sayers_14 absolutely. We might not be quite there for the title yet but we're good enough for top four and a trophy.
@sayers_14 hopefully Pochettino doesn't put out a strong team for the tournament then throw it at our first real challenge a la last year.
@sayers_14 I know nothing about Gent but I'm assuming that's because they're not all that. That side should hopefully be strong enough.
@sayers_14 you can't have it both ways Joe.
@IsaiahBright4 @TrickTrick85 @bet365 https://t.co/zQCdVRc30t
@tehTrunk while I agree I will still allow myself to enjoy an Arsenal thumping.
@josh_creator a nice 10-1 on aggregate would be brilliant.
@josh_creator tactically speaking it would be better for both of us but I will allow myself to enjoy Arsenal getting pantsed.
@josh_creator nor do I mate. 4-1 now. Keep 'em coming!
@josh_creator the closest man to the blatant handball and he didn't see it.
Love you @Arsenal
That's more like it @Arsenal
You're ruining me watching Arsenal getting hammered @Arsenal.
@Bateseyboy @miamibyrne absolutely. Unless the difference is us finishing above Arsenal I'll take 3rd and Leicester going down.
@grayjam68 @Sgt_shred1 it is. You recognise that writhing torso anywhere hey G? x
@Sgt_shred1 @grayjam68 taught him everything he knows.
@CHLiquid after years of searching I've finally found my happy place.
@CHLiquid I find it quite calming.
https://t.co/ZSfJo0FYiw
@riddley82 turns out you were right.
@twentysixreds Newcastle are a big team. Probably have a spread out fan base and it's easier for southerners to see them in these parts.
@twentysixreds yeah theyre harmless. I've been to Spurs Newcastle a few times and your lot are always nice. Apart from ol' horse punch obvs.
@twentysixreds that is odd. I haven't done Norwich away for a few seasons, nice little ground to be fair.
@HotspurRelated https://t.co/jmrYdJ0KkL
@IndyFootball @Independent that's the spirit. (It won't happen though.)
Is there such a thing as a food hangover? Because I think I have one.
@twentysixreds I thought the floodgates were open when you scored in the first minute. Turns out you were lucky with a point!
@Craig_Spur tragic.

@Bateseyboy @epic_24 we don't have the wage structure for good enough back ups to win the league. We're good enough for top 4 and a trophy.
@Bateseyboy @epic_24 absolutely. Don't get me wrong, the league would be the best trophy to win but it's such a long shot.
@Bateseyboy @epic_24 frustrating thing is that if we went all out for the FA Cup and EL the chances are wed probably win one or both of them
@epic_24 @Bateseyboy yeah I know mate. Ridiculous question.
@1LaneOnly @Bateseyboy it shouldn't be difficult for them to beat a nervy Josh Onomah, CCV and Kevin Wimmer at Wembley.
@1LaneOnly @Bateseyboy I know. And it frustrates the hell out of the vast majority of the fans.
@1LaneOnly @Bateseyboy but it's a cup and we haven't won anything since 2008. League finishes mean nothing unless they're 1st.
@Bateseyboy how the hell is this even a question? Even if winning EL didn't come with a CL spot I'd rather win silverware then finish 4th.
@lukedawson86 I think it's all been great but this season has been the slowest bar some brilliant episodes. Fell asleep through last night's
Here we go..... #TheWalkingDead
@JamesTaylorAG @Bateseyboy same. These are shocking stats tbf.
@_Ubique__ yep, March 14th.
@_Ubique__ I'd say she does mate. I'm making an effort tomorrow but that's mostly to put me in credit for steak and blowjob day next month.
@CHLiquid @_Ubique__ used that exact tactic when I used my vouchers at pizza express on Saturday lunchtime.
@_Ubique__ ah nice. just pay and don't let her see you show your ID. How long have you been with her? More then a few months wouldn't matter
@_Ubique__ use the coupon but pay on the sly. Something like "I have to pay at the till because I'm paying by card".
@Annaml1988 narrow Brexit margins but you're officially weird xxx https://t.co/ido7NKhQuO
@JackCooper5991 I've been working with a Liverpool fan all day too.
@stylishriot this is fantastic.
@Bateseyboy the sexual tension between you two is unbearable.
@gamray I Wikipedia an episode of whatever series I'm watching after I've seen it and usually end up reading about the next one. Thats weird
#NowWatching Bronson.
If we're about to watch a film my girlfriend will quickly YouTube the trailer. That's weird isn't it? Is that weird...
@Bateseyboy @PainInTheArse what I dont understand is Spurs fans resenting Leicester winning it. They stopped Arsenal being champions. Heroes
@shelleyj89 Channel 4 right now. Classic.
@JakeDilworth the gossipy, small talk of everyone you know.
I. AM. JOB.
.@MoronsRTed should have way more followers then it has.
@gamray gets better as it goes on. Stick with it.
@LonMaurice *couldn't
@LonMaurice they look they're at the high school prom together because they could get girls to go with them.
@LonMaurice she lucked out on who's looks she got them didn't she?
@LonMaurice SHE'S the daughter of that racist wotsit?!
@gbacon85 traditionally they're the top six team I don't mind as much as the others but they're making their way onto my shit list.
@Billie_T @Bateseyboy supporting a nearly team is far more painful then supporting a team you expect nothing from.
@Bateseyboy @Billie_T maybe we're all depressed. It has to count as some sort of self harm to be a supporter.
@Billie_T hate is in fashion.
Last time we beat them I was sitting in Park Lane Upper and Bale and Lennon scored. It feels like a lifetime ago.
Why can't we beat Liverpool? We're better then them man for man and have finished above them in seven of the last eight seasons.
@BeckyJ27 I'm still really pissed off about it. It's been a good season but we could so easily have won this game.
@BeckyJ27 https://t.co/HkZe1SRh1T
@84spurs84 to be fair though, this does account for all of our losses this season.
@PokemonGoApp it's cool how you've jacked up the prices for coins. That'll get people playing an already dead game again.
@JohnnyTheYid has to be a joke. Or I could be giving the right wing too much credit.
@MTTRDDN @Sgt_shred1 oh Christ.
@Sgt_shred1 I think its a parody. Or I could be underestimating how stupid the right-wing can be.
This has to be a joke. "Stop Immigration" says immigrant. https://t.co/8MECMnsLqV
I just accidentally logged into Facebook so had a my first scroll through of '17. Nothing gets you irritated like a scroll through Facebook.
@kev_g1 @Craig_Spur @Tomfoins87 @Bevlar90 agree with that.
@Craig_Spur @Tomfoins87 @Bevlar90 no it doesn't. Today was a massive off day. A complete shit show.
@Tomfoins87 @Bevlar90 there is a massive drop between our starting XI and anything on our bench.
@Tomfoins87 @Bevlar90 so unlucky with injuries this season.
@Bevlar90 have to agree with Dan. Our first XI is the best in the league.
.@MoronsRTed deserves more followers.
@stylishriot I apologise.
@stylishriot 2nd, only lost 3 games (at Anfield, OT and Stamford Bridge) and we have the easiest run to the end of the season of the top 6.
@stylishriot @Independent @indy100 the man is a complete joke. I'd find him being president a lot funnier if it wasn't so fucking serious.
@eralcluap oh don't worry, I'm fully prepared for a collapse.
@eralcluap we have the easiest looking run towards he end of the season. Fancy us to finish 4th.
There's nothing between 2nd and 6th but of the top six (on paper) we have the easiest run by far for the rest of the season. #COYS
Every cloud... https://t.co/1bKlPBlKPO
Well that was fucking woeful.
@sayers_14 I went to bet 2-1 Spurs and accidentally did it for Liverpool. I'm hoping we can at least pull one back.
@sayers_14 please don't think about games before they happen again Joe.
@jackwebber33 follow @Stream_Planet mate. They're shit hot for links.
@jackwebber33 I'm the opposite mate. I wish I wasn't watching it.
I'm sorry I thought Davies was a reasonable back up for left back until half hour ago.
@RicheyRevol we've flopped this game. Tulisa must have sucked us off.
@SpursOfficial fuck off.
Hardly against the run of play.
@AnthonyAshton1 I put it on for Spurs once I'd made the mistake. Not much chance of that coming in at this rate.
We're playing like shit.
#COYS
Accidentally put my bet on 2-1 for Liverpool instead of Spurs. At least I'll have a consolation if that result comes in.
@FerrariNana11 happy birthday x
@RicheyRevol @sayers_14 that's what I told the missing persons unit during questioning anyway.

@grayjam68 @eralcluap only crabs and bugs.
@eralcluap @grayjam68 I had a takeaway last night mate. Ordered a Lamb Pathia and a cheese Naan. It's repeating on me this morning though.
We're a pretty good team now. Which is exactly why Liverpool won't lose to us later.
@grayjam68 @eralcluap I was just saying to Paul that that Lamb Pathia and Cheese Naan are really repeating on me this morning Graham.
@eralcluap @grayjam68 That Lamb Pathia and Cheese Naan are really repeating on me this morning Paul.
@stylishriot thanks Jim. Have you seen the line up to the French Download? I may have to go.

@JamesTaylorAG @spursycob @Craig_Spur @robMDK scored the goal against Palace then had a rebound against Hull. Dembele should be netting more

@whatfamm he's not hurting anyone. I also find him strangely entertaining. I hope people lay off him.
@whatfamm yep, bastards. Some people are determined to make Twitter like High School.
@RicheyRevol he pisses off the right people and his videos are weirdly entertaining. Good guy.
@CHLiquid @SchrodngrsTaint https://t.co/imGCehtT74
@CHLiquid @SchrodngrsTaint just signed a deal, teams on the up. If they came in though it'd probably be hard for him to resist.
@SchrodngrsTaint it'd be bizarre though. To stick through the AVB and Tim Sherwood days then leave when it got really good.
@84spurs84 we're obviously progressing nicely but this is a bit much. We haven't even won anything yet.
@sayers_14 I'm not into handegg but I agree, this theory is stupid. Most Americans who are into football follow Premier League teams.

@RicheyRevol luckily no one else was around to hear it.
BUT I DIDN'T REMOVE THE ITEM FROM THE FUCKING BAGGING AREA!!!
@Gibocarrizan I hate Chelsea but this is immense.
@GSPCECOYS @RicheyRevol to be fair that's quite cheap. Ipswich isn't that far from me either...
@ChrisDoughty32 @_Ubique__ and I apologise about the poor grammar of that tweet.
@ChrisDoughty32 @_Ubique__ on paper we should beat them but as we can win and be out of sight of them makes me think we'll lose our bottle.
@stylishriot @Tomfoins87 @02BJT exactly. It almost didn't feel like a win. But it was and that's all that matters.
@stylishriot @Tomfoins87 @02BJT a 1-0 thrashing if you like.
@thespursweb DDWWW
@Tomfoins87 @02BJT just rewatched it on MOTD. As much as it should have been 5-0 it was dangerously close to 1-1 at the end there.
@spursycob it was a tough choice. Dembele just edged it for me.
Lloris, Alderweireld, Dembele, Eriksen, Kane. https://t.co/FB16blR6nH
@FerrariNana11 @RicheyRevol I always preferred The Backdoor Boys.
@Tomfoins87 traditionally, it felt like a nervy affair at the time but looking back on it they were never going to do anything.
@Tomfoins87 they were playing like they were defending a point at 1-0 down. Bizarre.
@FerrariNana11 @RicheyRevol I love N'Sync.
@FerrariNana11 @RicheyRevol really impressive actually. Looks like a right ol' party.

@COYS1986 @_Ubique__ hahahaha.
@_Ubique__ they have to come at us to try and catch us up in the league. Boro are still playing like they're defending a point!?
@_Ubique__ agree with that. Both teams will go for it and we have a bit too much for them imo.
@eralcluap I think this is what he's about mate.
This Tweet from @richiekpuk has been withheld in response to a report from the copyright holder.
@LeeGallows of course you're a pessimist. You're a Spurs fan.
@TorontoHooligan think he's been our biggest threat.
@LeeGallows we're creating so many chances that one is bound to go in. That or more likely Boro will nick one against the run of play.
@CHLiquid I hope not. I'm less confident then I was before the other results came in!
So I guess now Arsenal and Liverpool have dropped points we'll have to do the same?
Hull!!!!
@SpursOfficial the best of what we have available. A strong team. #coys
@RyanHeatly honestly. It'd be fucking staggering if a 26 year old behaved like this.
@RyanHeatly I don't know what I'm more shocked by, the fact he hasn't been properly done over yet or that fact that he's 46.
I hate Chelsea but this is beautiful. https://t.co/6KL4QTkkne

Well that's work done. Now to begin the weekend.
@02BJT Chelsea have won the league weather they win today or not. Fuck Arsenal, I hope they get pantsed.

@Sgt_shred1 each to their own man. Loved it personally but Green Day from 2004 onwards blow imo.
@Sgt_shred1 that album is evidence that Green Day were once upon a time a good band.
@RicheyRevol blood, faeces and another whiteish, translucent liquid. Not really sure what that one was.
@Dierbetes rookie social media mistake. The mistake of Facebook users.
@RicheyRevol it was like a shitty abattoir.
@Bateseyboy I hope you're not assuming I'm that sort of girl. (I totally am.)
Matchbook - Strung Out https://t.co/cKdl0rR3s6
@Bateseyboy I'll book the tickets
@Bateseyboy be still my beating heart
.@Bateseyboy well? https://t.co/oiYRDluo5Z
@SpursOfficial this isn't an update?! It tells us nothing.
@1882Marco same here. I was rightly expecting a five or six nil win.
@02BJT @jonestowncoffee the best so far I think. Fucking hate the bloke but he's a good source of comedy.
@1882Marco would have thought we had underachieved if we won 2-0. Couldn't believe we drew.
@jonestowncoffee @02BJT I fucking love this.
@Sgt_shred1 welcome to 2017.
@Just_Me_NiNi I'm not sure but he works directly for the president and can confidently and openly say something so xenophobic. Horrendous.
The closing few seconds  https://t.co/0FvARMTIin
Sunderland. 0-0. What a bullshit result. #THFC
#COYS
@WardHammer2017 but your display pic will soon put them off.
@WardHammer2017 you're welcome. I will warn you, your @ makes you look like a West Ham fan. That may invite some Brexit div followers.
@WardHammer2017 I'll give you a crash course later sweetie x
Worried Lloris tweet.
@WardHammer2017 one is the giver, the other the receiver.
@WardHammer2017 haha welcome back to twitter.
@baldsquire I often wish for this. Go back to 16 year old knowing what I know now but without the glitchy, drug addled mind.
@RicheyRevol @stylishriot @whosethatNana11
@Bateseyboy @poshpig3008 found myself really rooting for Spud all the way through
@riki_rikidance bit of both really... no, actually just the first one.
@Bateseyboy @poshpig3008 it wasn't going to touch the original but could have been terrible. Wasnt awestruck but entertained. 6.5/10 is fair
@Bateseyboy @poshpig3008 agree. I enjoyed it though. When a sequel comes out decades later it quite often butchers the first one. This didnt
@AssembleTheArmy really enjoyed #Trainspotting2. It could have been terrible but I thought they did a really good job.
@Bateseyboy @poshpig3008 I thought it was brilliant.
They could have butchered Trainspotting 2. Luckily it was great.
Here we go... #Trainspotting2 https://t.co/OYvpYV5Y0X
Fulham away. That'll do. #FACupdraw #COYS
@AssembleTheArmy same mate. My life began at 28 when I stopping putting that shit in my veins. I'll give you my review in a couple hours
@Bateseyboy @Bevlar90 should only cost around 35 million too.
@HullCity brilliant news. Get well soon @RyanMason.
@AssembleTheArmy as a recovering addict I vouch that there is no better drug then life. (Off to see the second one tonight!)
@misskayleigh any seven hour shift sounds nice to me!
@misskayleigh that an incredibly nocturnal shift. What do you do?
@JamesTaylorAG I used to be able to get away with a Twitter skive. Not so much anymore, we're flat out.
How do some of you get away with tweeting all day? Do you not have jobs or do you neglect yours?
At least Rock Against Trump should be a good album @fat_wreck
@shelleyj89 that Nicola is horrible to them. Jamie O'Hara is a massive chode, I'm glad I don't know the personalities of most footballers!
@shelleyj89 annoying as they are they're the only ones in there with any shred of personality. They're constantly ganged up on by the others
@stylishriot don't think I've heard Slapshot. Ill have to give them a go. Ever heard Leatherface? Worth checking out https://t.co/21B3ZvzEFH
@stylishriot you like Belvedere? Their album that came out last year is pretty banging x
@Jake_Rockett https://t.co/FRN2B58Goh
@LeeGallows yes, then feel disappointed when I discover it hasn't happened yet.
@Sgt_shred1 just loads of bickering mate.
@JamesTaylorAG @Craig_Spur good old boy. There's a lack of Tottenham on Tottenham Twitter tonight.
@stylishriot how'd the eye stuff go the other day mate?
@stylishriot yeah man I love Jawbreaker. Haven't heard them in ages!
@stylishriot might take my off-season break a little early this year mate. I've lost a lot of love for it on here in recent months.
@JohnnyTheYid @grayjam68 you're both lovely. So much bickering on here these days, it's catching up to Facebook for bullshit drama.
Twitter is vile these days.
@Samfr @JRHartley1 @politicshome racist xenophobe agrees with other racist xenophobe shocker.
@twentysixreds got a ticket for 19:45 tomorrow. Well looking forward to seeing it.
@riddley82 tomorrow night mate. I don't give it all away on the first date though. (I totally do.)
Trainspotting 2 ticket booked.
@02BJT Arsenal away nailed on.
@02BJT I think we massively underestimated them while also playing a second string team. We'd be up for Millwall away.
@SeanWalsh_97 @premierleague @ManCity what on earth did Lloris see in us back then?
@CookPassTim happy Sunday to you too my fellow snowflake
I'd really like to see us get Millwall away in the next round.
Carvery time. I've done some good eating this weekend.
https://t.co/EpsX7qIpn6
https://t.co/Jznr8krH8C
@JamesTaylorAG hope they win today and we get them in the next round.
@grayjam68 @JamesTaylorAG right here Graham, with your tongue.
@JamesTaylorAG it'd be like fucking Jennifer Lawrence but catching aids.
Just posted a photo https://t.co/t0XhPUm8qj
@grayjam68 @JamesTaylorAG as long as it's a pencil with an eraser at the Jurgen Topp.
@G_Man_Baker @Bevlar90 I don't think so. It'd be like getting Sissoko and selling Chadli all over again.
@OnAMadness @Bateseyboy @BigDannyP_81 @Flav_Bateman would be a kid's birthday magician today.
@grayjam68 @JamesTaylorAG wouldn't be bad news would it?
@WindyCOYS @BenPearceSpurs @jilllewis33 not in the new system we don't. Davies is only capable backup in a flat back four.
@riddley82 haha nah mate. Whys that?
@Bevlar90 oh Christ, I forgot about this bloke. What an absolute joke.
@BenPearceSpurs @jilllewis33 @WindyCOYS difficult unless you have a wage structure like Chelsea or Man City unfortunately.
@tamsysam79 @Bateseyboy @BigDannyP_81 @Flav_Bateman so do I. I was really regretting tweeting about Liverpool so much at half time.
@tamsysam79 @Bateseyboy @BigDannyP_81 @Flav_Bateman what a great way to make us actually appreciate beating Wycombe Wanders though.
@G_Man_Baker as rhetorical as your question is I think Lamela and Son will if we keep playing this formation. They deserve regular game time
@BigDannyP_81 @Bateseyboy @tamsysam79 @Flav_Bateman ditto!
@Bateseyboy @tamsysam79 @BigDannyP_81 @Flav_Bateman why do you think we're up so early on a Sunday?
@Bateseyboy @tamsysam79 @BigDannyP_81 @Flav_Bateman hahaha nice segway. Cheers mate, now I'm going to be stuck in a Lamela thread.
@tamsysam79 @Bateseyboy @BigDannyP_81 @Flav_Bateman that thing where you believe something without any proof whatsoever? Yeah I think it is.
@Bateseyboy pizza is the worst for me. Gives me what can only be described as constipated diarrhoea the next day.
@riddley82 I wonder if bookies are giving odds?
@Bateseyboy it was immense mate. Repeating on me this morning though.
@Bateseyboy it was immense mate. Repeating on me this morning though.
@Bateseyboy @BigDannyP_81 @Flav_Bateman of course they couldn't. Lovely people with the best of intentions, just bat-shit mental.
@richiekpuk urgh, just realised I went with the 52%.
Donald Trump is going to get shot in the face isn't he?
@BigDannyP_81 @Bateseyboy @Flav_Bateman I'm pretty sure an all powerful god could have built a pre-fertilised earth.
@BigDannyP_81 @Bateseyboy @Flav_Bateman a Jehovah's Witness once told me they were put there to fertilise the earth.
@BlueWatchmonk a bizarre game. I was going to go but didn't bother because I just assumed it'd just be sweeping aside a lower league team.
#TeamWatchingMOTD
@Sgt_shred1 hard seats? Piles?
@_Peter_1980 if I was on death row I'd order it as my last meal. The food of kings.
@grayjam68 @stylishriot make yourself a cuppa mate. I'd do it but can't because of said not being able to move.
@_Peter_1980 the banquet from my local. Starter, main, rice, naan, side dish, cobra beer of bottle of coke. 15.
@stylishriot smashed it mate. Can't move now.
Twitter has spoken. https://t.co/1AudAw0GP6
@riddley82 @CookPassTim people do things differently outside of Norfolk don't they?
@MajesticMousa haha course not. Just to be clear, I'm not going to fuck my takeaway. (I might.)
@CookPassTim brown for main, white for pudding.
In celebration of heroically beating League Two titans Wycombe Wanderers, I'm getting a takeaway. Should I get..
@Dan_KP harsh but fair.
@grayjam68 @JamesTaylorAG @kev_g1 he needs to be Jurgen Dropped.
Well that was almost humiliating. #COYS
*Returns to laughing at Liverpool*
*Quickly deletes tweets laughing at Liverpool*
#COYS
@grayjam68 @kev_g1 @JamesTaylorAG if you think this is ending anytime soon Graham, you're in for a Jurgen Shock.
@realDonaldTrump grab them by the pussy.
@grayjam68 @JamesTaylorAG these jokes are rubbish. You both need to Jurgen Stopp.
@RickSpur you literally just said Son needs to prove himself.
@02BJT @whatfamm Son doesn't need to prove himself. You'd have thought you didn't need to point that out.
@02BJT @whatfamm I used to think he worked for the club with the way he tweeted. Nope, just a weird guy.
@Bateseyboy needs to go out on loan at the least. I hoped it'd work out for him but you can't flog a dead horse for too long a la Soldado.
@Bateseyboy there's no coming back now.
@riddley82 @Independent I had mushroom tea at lot in my teens but that was an entirely different circumstance.
A drink that tastes like mould and gives you anxiety. Lovey. https://t.co/ls6rkWFQGQ
@empireofthekop except for the ones that are onside, which is all of them.
@nickzegreek @Tomfoins87 @karren_brady I take a weird satisfaction out of other teams hating us so it doesn't bother me.
@nickzegreek @Tomfoins87 @karren_brady she talks an awful lot about Tottenham doesn't she?
Juggling Jim's spot.  https://t.co/472kicIbQW
@Tomfoins87 @hammerandtalk that Carroll bicycle kick will keep them going for the next season tbf mate.
@stylishriot @hammerandtalk @Tomfoins87 @karren_brady we all need a hobby.
@hammerandtalk @Tomfoins87 @karren_brady I'm not basing it on a Sun article, I'm basing it on the dozens of tweets from fans who heard it.
@Craig_Spur @Bateseyboy @biscuitbeck "get off your sister, it's your Father's turn."
@Craig_Spur @Bateseyboy @biscuitbeck but yeah, Norfolk is weird. The people are as backwards as the land is flat.
@Craig_Spur @Bateseyboy @biscuitbeck I live near Norwich and have a lot of Norwich fan friends. I've been as a neutral a few times.
@Bateseyboy @Craig_Spur @biscuitbeck been there a few times. We've won everytime.
@G_Man_Baker should still be more then enough.
@Bateseyboy @biscuitbeck my first game was at Carrow Road. '93 I think. We won 2-1.
@Tomfoins87 @karren_brady isn't West Ham that team who play crowd noise through speakers?
@noonecarestoday @CHLiquid the worst part of being a celebrity paedophile has to be being friends with @piersmorgan.
@whosethatNana11 quite fit isn't she?
@CookPassTim what an inspired nickname/insult.
@CHLiquid ah no offence taken mate. But I know Norfolk for what it is, the land is as flat as the people are backwards.
@CHLiquid ah no offence taken mate. But I know Norfolk for what it is, the land is as flat as the people are backwards.
@Independent @indy100 https://t.co/33OngYR8VQ
@SchrodngrsTaint haha no, I'm saying it wouldn't make my worst 10.
@SchrodngrsTaint of the worst ten women I've slept with? My followers would plummet like the pound after Brexit.
@noonecarestoday I'm in a WhatsApp group that's pretty much based on sharing weird shit like this.
@SchrodngrsTaint wouldn't make my worst 10.
My alarm isn't going to go off tomorrow and it's going to be just splendid.
https://t.co/PmYfF7VXEu
@bet365Gaming Jimmy Eat World are the only band that aren't total muck on the lineup.
@CHLiquid when you're right you're right.
I don't know about you, but it's feeling minus two....
@KeefsLoveChild @MattISpurs exactly. The team spirit is great and theyre all playing well. It means theyre all more likely to stay together.
@ItsTomCreed how do know so much about the expensive poo machine?
@MattISpurs its good to see the whole team getting on but I failed to see how it was a prank.
@ItsTomCreed this Costa has given me a lot of energy. It's really energised my bowels, now I fancy a nap.
Costa Express, work your magic.
@stylishriot Christ that's brutal. Good luck bro x
@Bateseyboy fit.
@merchantofshite you have a ten year old in you?
@RicheyRevol @scottdougie went fairly often when I was a kid. Didn't get membership until I was in my teens though.
@scottdougie @RicheyRevol yeah. Think it's dawning on fans that games at White Hart Lane are very much numbered too.
@CHLiquid I love cooking as long as it requires minimal effort.
@scottdougie @RicheyRevol it's a fucking nightmare getting tickets. The number of applicants is even bigger now we've hit form.
@RicheyRevol I've only managed the "home" Champions League games, Sunderland and West Brom this season. It's really annoying.
@JamesTaylorAG cheers bro. Much appreciated.
Cooking for myself tonight. It's like a ten year old is allowed to chose his own dinner. https://t.co/n909kB3rEf
@JamesTaylorAG me and my father in law mate.
I've been unsuccessful for Everton tickets. Depressing that I'm only going to have been twice in WHL's last season.

@tomackyyy @SchrodngrsTaint @PhatPoch lovely stuff. All friends. I wish Twitter was always like this.
@stylishriot @OlyLister me too. Nice.
@tomackyyy @PhatPoch @SchrodngrsTaint I don't know mate. It's Twitter, it happens.
@SchrodngrsTaint @CookPassTim @PhatPoch I enjoyed it.
@PhatPoch @SchrodngrsTaint hahahahahahaharsh.
@MrCracknell @_1lucky July 2013 for me
@Morlio18 and the cunts of twitter.
@richspurs24 give in to the temptation! I will be at the weekend.
@stylishriot I can't stop watching it

@hurst_craig a true legend around these parts.
@sassageflare https://t.co/oXLpL60WVa
@twentysixreds https://t.co/oXLpL60WVa
@sassageflare nothing official but it's all over facebook.
@twentysixreds very strongly rumoured.
This will only mean something to my like, three followers from King's Lynn but;RIP Juggling Jim
@Bateseyboy if I'm awake my phone is in my hand. That probably has something to do with it.
@Bateseyboy iPhone 6s. It'll be a year old next month. I love the phone and the software but the battery lifespan is dogshit.
@lukedawson86 mines doing the same. My phone will go from fully charged to 40% then it'll die
@Harry_Sherlock @herbsy77 it's almost like they make them so you have to buy a new one every two years!
@tamsysam79 tried it. I think it was the man-child pokemoning over the summer that's fried my battery.
@SlapMeLow13 it's a horrible thing to go through. Really is like losing a member of the family.
THE. LAST. JEDI.
9:34. Barely used my phone. 45% battery. iPhones really are terrible.
Get well soon @RyanMason! #OneOfOurOwn  https://t.co/Vkhrb6njDV
@SchrodngrsTaint @Bevlar90 fingers crossed mate. #OneOfOurOwn
@SchrodngrsTaint @Bevlar90 fractured skull and bleeding on brain. Horrendous. Get well soon @RyanMason x
@JamesTaylorAG what were the Top 5 guesses?
@baldsquire sounding good man.
Memories.  https://t.co/0kjhSRtf5H
@kayleighboo22 yup. A full night's sleep really puts me in the mood for a nap.
@kayleighboo22 it's my superpower. Fatigue-Man.
@Bateseyboy @DDFootyFactory I don't get filming at games full stop. You have Match of the Day for watching the game back.
@Mmords22 they're my friends too. In the same way my dealers used to be.
@Mmords22 @dominos it's not only them. It's my local kebab houses too! Its like they know I'm fat and weak.
OK FINE I'LL ORDER ONE! @dominos
@sayers_14 see.
@sayers_14 Arsenal are still going to win.
@_Ubique__ @Bateseyboy we'll have to be very careful what venues we play when we tour Los Angeles.
@Bateseyboy @_Ubique__ me too.Richie "Long Junk" Cripps.
@RicheyRevol I know the smell well....
@Harry_Sherlock I hope not. I never got round to putting a tenner on them going down.
I know I'm fat but could you stop texting me please @dominos?
@zaitampan @Youngerweireld he's well and truly forgiven. If anyone is allowed an off day, it's him.
@twentysixreds haha. Did you get the reference? You must have, you know the script as well as I do.
@twentysixreds are you worried about AIDS?
@ItsTomCreed looked it mate but he's totally forgiven. I can count on one hand the amount of bad games he's had.
Just watching the highlights back. If anyone is in credit with us enough to be allowed to have a bad game it's Hugo Lloris.
After feeling cocksure all week the nerves have hit and I'm now certain we'll lose. #COYS
@nickzegreek King's Lynn. Nothing massive but they draw in a 500-1000 person crowd and it takes up all the parking in a three street radius.
Fucking nightmare living opposite the football ground. If I come home on a Saturday afternoon I have to park a ten minute walk away.
@gbacon85 yep. A chance to get three points on City and Liverpool today. Could be huge.
Liverpool
I wish I was getting up early to go to Manchester to watch Spurs like the rest of you. Nope, up early to fit a bathroom.
@baldsquire can't imagine he'll be taken seriously by his board. "Yes Donald. Ok. You go play on Twitter over there, we'll sort this out."
@Deb_spurs @colinwright1959 it's been a good couple of years for hate.
@Bateseyboy @RicheyRevol @stylishriot we nearly made our mate sit on another table when he ordered a Chicken Tikka Masala the other week.
@Craig_Spur makes absolutely no sense. It was all down to Jeremy Peace who you'd think would want to cash in while he could?
@riddley82 was kind of hoping we'd go back in for him tbf.
Berahino has barely played for West Brom since we bid 15m more in 2015 then they got for him today. They've been paying his wages too. Why?
@Bateseyboy @RicheyRevol @stylishriot has to be lamb. Beef doesnt seem to work and people who like chicken only like the missionary position
@Bateseyboy @RicheyRevol @stylishriot huh? Keema isn't winning?
Sia - Chandelier https://t.co/sX2hNVdF1O
@sayers_14 no we're not. Could end the weekend three points behind where we are. (Pssst, I still think we're going to win.)
@sayers_14 I don't like not being under the radar.
Donald Trump. President. Jesus fucking Christ.
@Jake_Rockett @Phillip_The_Fox sick to my stomach.
Just posted a photo https://t.co/PUktvlSbrL
@gloryglorytott the place has no sentimental value to you at all? I've been going since I was six years old. I'm really going to miss it.
@Tomfoins87 @Dan_KP a pint, thereof.
@JaiP72 @JackCooper5991 @JamesTaylorAG @bensalvi23 @SpursOfficial I dont drink but prefer the authentic boozy atmosphere to a commercial one
Today is a sad, sad day. https://t.co/fuOe49eKlw
@02BJT thanks for the... https://t.co/qQE5pHtbBH
@02BJT finally, someone took the hint.
I've been spoilt by working 5 minute's walk from my house for the last 9 months. 5:30 alarms and an hour and a half traveling are a killer.
@SpursOfficial this is hella impressive.
A 5:45am start and a racist reality star being sworn into the White House later. I've had better Fridays. https://t.co/GgalGszpCt
@HotspurInsider didn't happen.
@JamesTaylorAG is fingering something you grow out of or has it gone out of fashion? #AskJT
@JamesTaylorAG of course.
@JamesTaylorAG yep. Hopefully Poch doesn't put all his chips on the league every year that he's with us.
@JamesTaylorAG yep, it was missing silverware to give us a really fond memory of them though.
This place isn't the same without Harney.
@Annaml1988 @heidimontag loser.
@RicheyRevol @SniersMoregut that team played immense football. I can't help but feel we deserved something to show for it.
@RicheyRevol @SniersMoregut the midfield alone should have bought in a Carling or FA cup at least. Not forgetting K https://t.co/h3q7eRxjoB
@SniersMoregut this team needs silverware to be remembered otherwise it'll be remembered for underachieving, like Redknapp's side.
@RichArrowsmith Spurs legend.
@RichArrowsmith against Bolton in and FA cup game wasn't it? Hammered them all game and he came on and got the winner.
@stylishriot I'm glad you don't actually see most footballer's personalities. It'd probably make supporting your team a lot harder.
@RichArrowsmith https://t.co/4RvFNDVDE5
@gbacon85 @RicheyRevol @stylishriot @DreamStateUK yeah, I've heard this. It's a pretty good listen. You check out new Violent Soho?
Lost out in my application to Stoke at home! Stoke?! Getting tickets this season has been a right pain in the tits.
@JamesTaylorAG @Kor3anMessi @ShaunBiggs1 doesn't matter. It's his twitter, he can block who he likes.
@JamesTaylorAG @Kor3anMessi @ShaunBiggs1 I liked a tweet disagreeing with him in a debate then, BAM, gone. Always got on with him too.
@Kor3anMessi @JamesTaylorAG @ShaunBiggs1 I probably would. She wouldn't even be in my worst ten. I'm also blocked by Shaun btw.
@MattISpurs @RicheyRevol brilliant work sir.
@RicheyRevol what adorable names.
@MattISpurs @RicheyRevol ok man. When you come back to twitter you'll Make Me Whole Again.
@MattISpurs @RicheyRevol just joking bro
The word 'banter' makes me think of someone as funny as ring sting.
@RicheyRevol @MattISpurs or when the lead singer left the Lostprophets.
@RicheyRevol @MattISpurs I know, being away from you was punishment enough.
@MattISpurs did three months between last football season and this one. It was refreshing not to have had a summer staring at my phone.
@CookPassTim @WxrdProwse Pochettino one needed.
@WelhamOfficial @JackH_THFC @SpursOfficial @stokecity exactly. All the holders in the part that got torn down needed reseating too.
@LonMaurice agree.
@LonMaurice consider myself slightly left of centre. I don't get offended for the sake of being offended but know when something isn't on.
@LonMaurice exactly how I feel. Not overly bothered by it but it's not really on and I'd rather our fans didn't sing it.
@WelhamOfficial @JackH_THFC @SpursOfficial @stokecity it's a pain in the tits. I'm hoping to mine was successful. Suppose it's a 2/3 chance.
@JackH_THFC @SpursOfficial @stokecity it's sold out mate. They had 6000 tickets available and there were 9000 applications.
@Craig_Spur @JanVertonghen @SpursOfficial yeah it's not gospel by any means. Hopefully it's not as bad as it looked.
@Craig_Spur @JanVertonghen @SpursOfficial reading reports it could be up to ten weeks. Not ideal.
This just makes sense for everybody. Good luck @tom_carroll92. https://t.co/mfdaZ7OFtR
@JanVertonghen all the best mate. I wish you a speedy recovery x
@JamesTaylorAG @neileatson actually, beggars can't be choosers. I'll take it whatever.
@JamesTaylorAG @neileatson hmmm, what's the source of this hair?
@JamesTaylorAG @neileatson well that's me out. I have less facial hair then most women.
@twentysixreds thanks hot stuff  xxx
@CHLiquid well we certainly have no secrets.
@JamesTaylorAG I'm like that with Kevin Smith movies, Monty Python and Airplane.
@JamesTaylorAG when I read out what I had downloading to my mate yesterday he was shocked that I hadn't seen it.
@JamesTaylorAG when I read out what I had downloading to my mate yesterday he was shocked that I hadn't seen it.
@Bateseyboy neither are Jan's quality but with Dier and Alderweireld playing beside them both are perfectly capable.
@JamesTaylorAG it's on my hard drive and ready to go!
@Sgt_shred1 @02BJT @stylishriot I'll have a look mate. Honestly though, New Jersey Death Sauce.
@JamesTaylorAG I didn't think Wimmer did a bad job when he stepped in last season though personally.
@CHLiquid Friends is just background television. Also thank god for the incognito option on google.
@JamesTaylorAG oh, haha. Make it quite likely then.
@JamesTaylorAG not bad. Doubt Southampton would sell in January though?
@JamesTaylorAG who would like us to realistically go in for?
@Sgt_shred1 @02BJT @stylishriot I'm pretty hard when it comes to hot food. Not sure I could handle the hottest chilli ever though.
Being laid up on the sofa ill is just Comedy Central playing the same two episodes of Friends to you all day.
@gp6970 @JamesTaylorAG I get the sentiment of Option A but seeing Spurs win multiple titles exceeds my dreams. Option B without a doubt.
@Sgt_shred1 @02BJT @stylishriot no mate, what's that? Ps order some New Jersey Death Sauce.
@brnurse @stylishriot @LessThanJake same, and I'm 32.
@Sgt_shred1 @02BJT @stylishriot absolutely. I like my food to hurt.
@stylishriot needs jalapeos.
@SirAlex_K he'd make a great addition to any squad. The money they'd demand for his age wouldnt be worthwhile. Plus they'd never sell to us.
@SirAlex_K surely they'll come now it's common knowledge he doesn't want to be there?
@ItsTomCreed there's no bigger test then being a Tottenham fan. Thanks mate!
@ItsTomCreed never made a CA meeting but they sound great. I do AA every week. I don't get to NA as much as I'd like due to lack of meetings
@ItsTomCreed thanks bro! And well done to you, that's a hell of an achievement. You using NA or AA?
Today I'm three and a half years clean and sober. #NA #AA
@Craig_Spur the second game I ever took my girlfriend to. She had 10 on 3-1 and has been pissed off with football ever since.
@Annaml1988 remember this? https://t.co/QZP90ss2nK
@hatspur thats a good way of looking at it. I don't often get ill and have been for a few days now so am making the most of moaning about it
@flaming_meaux @Tomfoins87 @RichArrowsmith he looked good for the half hour he was on Saturday. Neither are Jan's quality but both capable.
@Tomfoins87 @flaming_meaux Davies. He plays CB for Wales so is able. Jan has roamed forward a bit more in this formation which suits him.
@flaming_meaux @Tomfoins87 I agree. He's definitely in our best XI but he's probably the easiest to replace of it.
@Craig_Spur thought it was more slapstick then the first two. Agree, could have been way worse. Thought it was a watchable 6/10.
@LeeGallows I think all fans would. Last season was bizarre, we played a strong team until our strongest opposition then Poch just threw it.
@Craig_Spur wasn't as good as the first two but was ok.
#NowWatching Brotherhood
@LeeGallows @SpursOfficial I'd love us to win it. We have the squad to go all out on the EL and PL, hopefully Poch sees it the same way.

@twentysixreds I'll give it a go!
@CHLiquid @eralcluap glad you asked. https://t.co/SkCA8l8gBd
@TheTottenhamWay Man City getting hammered 4-0 the game before they play us, a good thing or a bad thing?
@RicheyRevol all twitter approved.

@WesinhoimSuden thanks bro.
@SpursInTheBlood @thfcBran it's literally with every goal now. Such a sense of comradery in this team.
@WesinhoimSuden the news of being an uncle was soured for me as my nephews were claimed by my Arsenal fan brother-in-law.
@brnurse cheers bro. Now downloading.
@RicheyRevol I'm sure I had a children's book under the same title. Lots of pictures.
@Sgt_shred1 good suggestion. Been meaning to see this. Thanks bro.
@JamesTaylorAG heard of but never seen. Will download. Cheers man.
@CHLiquid @eralcluap haha bring it on Twitter!
I'm laid up on the sofa, ill off work. Any good film recommendations?
@eralcluap good man. I'm somewhat of an expert. My mouth can handle curries my arse can't.
@eralcluap two words: baby wipes.

@1882Marco hahahaha me neither mate. I'd find the fact he's actually been voted in hilarious if it wasn't so fucking serious.
@1882Marco cheers for the heads up! Will be watching that!

@JamesTaylorAG @AdamCarrollE5 @gp6970 over Christmas? Harsh. I'm ill as fuck right now but at least I get an unscheduled day off tomorrow.
@AdamCarrollE5 @JamesTaylorAG @gp6970 tbf I'd rather Chlamydia then this cold I've got. Four pills and it's gone. Ain't no cure for this.
@ericdier happy birthday you prefect example of a man
@grayjam68 @Bevlar90 32 years worth of pocket money incoming.
@grayjam68 @Bevlar90 the spritely young buck I imagine you were at sixteen you could well be Graham.
@Bevlar90 cheers bae
@grayjam68 @Bevlar90 how old are you then G?
@Bevlar90 fraid so.
@grayjam68 @Bevlar90 I'm done at 32 years old.
@shelleyj89 my girlfriend has last night's episode on. I think I need to insure the TV if that girl from Geordie Shore is going to be on it.
@whosethatNana11 alright rapey.
@Bateseyboy @JoeTweedie give me sweet, delicious murder any day.
@02BJT @premierleague still 6th. That squad and manager are massively underachieving. Nice.
@Shaun_TSP I don't think we're catching them either way but it's nice to see a meltdown there, even if it's a minor one.
@Shaun_TSP Chelsea's star man causing turmoil at theirs. And Payet refusing to play. (That last one doesn't really affect us, just funny).
I wish my girlfriend was Eric Dier. https://t.co/hOIOvZuuzz
@whosethatNana11 that tweet had more rape in it then South Africa.
Now THATS the 1-1 I was hoping for this weekend.
@SingleMaltSuds @tehTrunk my personal highlight in punditry history. https://t.co/gwnWpO0G93
@eralcluap they owe us for the last three results against them. Plus they'll wanna bounce back after this week. I still think we'll edge it.
@stylishriot great isn't it? But yeah, I think it's a bad thing. They'll be at the top of their game to set it right. They also owe us one.
I'm not sure if Man City getting pantsed 4-0 the game before they play us is a good or a bad thing?
What a game! #EVEMCI
@Sgt_shred1 @Craig_S_Ed @whatfamm gravy is an essential ingredient.
@therealtommitch congratulations mate!
Full of cold and feeling pants. Why did I agree to go and price a job up on a Sunday?
@sayers_14 it's great. If the defence needs back up three at the back can quickly become five at the back. It's a solid system.
@sayers_14 he's been brilliant. I can't think of a more reliable PL DM this season. I love that new system incorporates both him and Dier.
Love this. Gives the squad a good chance to rotate and it makes it difficult for teams to prepare for us.https://t.co/DteGrO2DZx
@Annaml1988 I'm dying.
@RicheyRevol @thesundaysport I'd best start shopping around for health insurance.
@josh_creator I agree. I should be hoping for a draw really but I can't ever hope for anything other then a Man Utd loss.
@josh_creator yeah mate. We've beaten them the last three times we've played them. They won't make it easy for us.
@josh_creator he did mate, ended 1-1 but should have been about 5-1 to you. He got man of the match I believe.
@josh_creator I remember when we hammered Newcastle's Tim Krul with a Premier League shot record at WHL and lost the game 1-0.
@LonMaurice I hope to god Jennifer Lawrence is involved.
@josh_creator how'd you fancy your chances tomorrow?
@josh_creator yeah probably mate. Luckily Kane was on better form then him today!
@Tomfoins87 @Craig_Spur would also have had a worldie, as is tradition.
@RicheyRevol @SchrodngrsTaint never letting that one go.
@Craig_Spur they all play well against us at home. Gomes' best game at White Hart Lane was when he played there with Watford last season.
@RicheyRevol @SchrodngrsTaint hahaha you joke but she literally doesn't. She lost it when she broke her nose in a play park accident age 10.
Could easily have been 8 or 9-0 today. Ben Foster in "Visiting GoalKeeper at White Hart Lane has incredible game" shocker.
@scottdougie the best teams have wage structures that keep squad players happy. Hes good enough to play more and on a better wage elsewhere.
@SchrodngrsTaint haha exactly. She's not a total moron or anything, she just has some amusing moronic moments.
@grayjam68 she doesn't get accents. It took some convincing that he wasn't.
Oi, Tony Pulis. Spin on that you prick.
@scottdougie I hope not. He's been on the bench more times then he's started since he signed for us. I think he's a better player then that.
@scottdougie he won't be happy to sit on the bench this much for too long. He'll be even further down the pecking order when Lamela returns.
My bird thinks the Dad from My Family is Kevin Spacey.
Son is pure quality but won't crack into the starting XI with the team playing like this. We'll lose him in the near future.
@Craig_Spur @Bevlar90 ffs. We can capable back up but he's definitely part of our best starting XI.
@Bevlar90 hopefully it's not too bad and he's back soon.
@eralcluap @AlexRoPo fair point. Wimmer capable and Davies plays centre back for Wales and looked solid today. Not ideal but not a disaster.
@Bevlar90 the reports don't sound reassuring. His ankle is apparently too swollen to get a proper assessment yet.
@AlexRoPo great, just before City too. There's always something to take the gloss off of a good result.
What actually happened with Vertonghen? I was focussed on Alderweireld hobbling about when it happened and I didn't see it.
Today's view. #COYS https://t.co/5sErmgFRQQ
Great result! #COYS
Total. Fucking. Moron. https://t.co/g5dg15vqSD
En route to the lane full of cold and feeling awful. Make this worthwhile @SpursOfficial.
#WhatIWouldTellA15YearOldMe sounds a bit obvious mate but, don't try heroin.
@hurst_craig one of them was at Newmarket races when we were on our works do. We started hauling abuse at him. Such non-celebrities.
@herbsy77 it's painful. Television at its most brainless and irriatating.
@grayjam68 it's painful. We have a few teenagers on our firm and they idolise the 'stars'. Reality TV is creating a generation of morons.
I fucking hate Geordie Shore, Ex on The Beach, TOWIE etc. If anything it's holding the human race back.
@AdamCimmering @KeefsLoveChild trying to make it as a celebrity 'lad'.
@SniersMoregut great point.
@Bevlar90 @Craig_Spur same!
@Bevlar90 and I'd do them with you.
@say_naaaatin @flaming_meaux peak Facebook.
Wise words. Totally agree. https://t.co/3npoTyosZ2
1-1
@MrOKanenas @WelshSpur07 I agree with my original tweet but disagree with all those disagreeing.
@Bateseyboy @WelshSpur07 @Craig_Spur I agree with the original tweet. Smart chap.
@voodoochopstiks he's our best player for slipping in behind the back line. A mixture of creativity and direct brute force is probably best.
@grayjam68 @RicheyRevol as if I'd let that love momentum go anyway.
Could do with Alli, Son and Eriksen on tomorrow. We need as much creativity as possible to break through Pulis' wall of anti-football.
@whatfamm if I was enraged by an opinion I'd use the 'don't follow or interact with them' technique. Done.
@baldsquire @stylishriot just listened to the first two tracks. They're pretty good. Nice one, I need new bands!
@grayjam68 @RicheyRevol that reminds me, you left some at mine Graham.
@grayjam68 naturally. I'm naturally slightly more rotund, after years of gorging on processed foods.
@grayjam68 how on earth do you still fit in that Graham?
@mstern68 @TheBoydP same. Covered in my faeces.
https://t.co/otlVrcFGTi
@thfcBrandon he's got me once with the follow/unfollow technique but he has the best @ on Spurs twitter.
Just eaten McDonald's for lunch and now feel as healthy as a pork scratching.
@herbsy77 news/small talk.
@herbsy77 I'd love this non-news to be true in these parts. A few days off work would go down a treat.

@lukedawson86 just shopping about for your birthday present.
@1882Marco so it's added to next year's Christmas list?
@katee_mstrs you're welcome.
@whosethatNana11 @JamieCHumphreys @TheTottenhamWay I'd have to agree.
@RyanHeatly no one could be ready for that.
I'd like you all to Google image search 'Walrus Dildo' please.
@Sgt_shred1 nor can I. He's as funny as chemotherapy.
I've never seen a James Corden's Carpool Karaoke. I can't imagine how horrible they are.
@rapharris_ a lot of fans probably saw the worst in him because of his past. Was solid for most of his games in a Spurs shirt to me.
@rapharris_ Gallas got a lot of unfair stick imo.
@JamieCHumphreys @TheTottenhamWay under my request she'd never wash again if she went with Toby.
@TheTottenhamWay if you had to walk in on your girlfriend with a Spurs player who would rather it be?
@rapharris_ congratulations mate.
@rapharris_ congratulations mate.
@_Peter_1980 never.
@katee_mstrs nope, it happened with my 4, 5, 6s. An iPhone battery over a year old just turns to shit.
Tottenham 2016/17:
Happy birthday @Billie_T!
@_Peter_1980 I love the iPhone software but the phones just go to shit after a year of having them.
My iPhone has got to that age where it hits 40% battery and just dies.
@Bateseyboy hopefully he does, it sparks has confidence and he becomes an able striker. Sad truth is I think we've imported another dud.

@PhatPoch @SchrodngrsTaint I went to send this picture to a WhatsApp group of my mates but accidentally sent it to one with my Mum in first.
@OlyLister @Independent all my problems: solved.
@02BJT @sayers_14 hopefully 'Eriksen' will make us tick.
@02BJT @sayers_14 lol @ 'Bobby' x 10.
@Just_Me_NiNi there's nothing bleaker then the sight of a Christmas tree once you're back at work.
@JFT13 my tweet worked! They're taking it down. The sight of a Christmas tree when you're back at work is as depressing as a speed comedown.
This Christmas tree outside my work needs to come down. It has no business being here and it's making me depressed.
@herbsy77 @JJohnson9193 King's Lynn and Twitter aren't the same without him x
@lukedawson86 no you are silly.
@bankruptspurs absolutely. We've done well to keep hold of Vorm, Trippier, Wimmer etc as back ups on our wage structure.
@PaiigeTheRage @RicheyRevol he's wrong.
@RicheyRevol he's wrong too then.
@RicheyRevol just because it has the highest amount of votes doesn't mean it's right. Look at Brexit.
@RicheyRevol had this conversation with someone last night. It's the first one.
@PaiigeTheRage https://t.co/vpJPD3QsoA
@HKane @KateGoodlandx congratulations to you both x
@tehTrunk getting harder to make excuses for with every game.
@RebelRamble @YidVids that's just about the best analogy I've ever heard.
@grayjam68 if he was truly Spurs he'd send Janssen off.
@elmartino_thfc we should have gone for a proven scorer like Austin, Man, Berahino etc.
@Jee_rad he also has the touch of a rapist.
We really need a second striker that isn't Janssen.
#COYS
Captain Dier
@Stream_Planet @TeamStreamKing @SportPlanet_ (voted yes btw)
@Stream_Planet @TeamStreamKing @SportPlanet_ bit glitchy lately but generally flawless. Really did me a treat for the Spurs game midweek!
@LonMaurice thanks mate.
@LonMaurice one thing England has a distinct lack of is ranch dressing. When I've been to the states I've come back with a suitcase full!
@rapharris_ can't believe it's been out since the 14th of last month and I've only seen it once.
@rapharris_ fantastic isn't it? That ending
@rapharris_ first time?
@DHarley1984 @stylishriot #guysguysguyscantwealljustgetalong
@AJSturt Vorm; Trippier, Alderweireld, Wimmer, Davies; Dier, Winks; Son, Eriksen, Sissoko; Kane.Something like that'd do the job.
@AJSturt it's our only game until next week. Why not?
@KeefsLoveChild happy birthday!
@josh_creator was always going to happen though mate. Thought it even when Bournemouth were 3-0 up the other night. Cunts.

@Dierbetes yes. You have the best @ on Spurs twitter.
@stylishriot @RicheyRevol not knocking Drive Thru. I loved some of the bands on the label. Finch just never seemed a Drive Thru band to me.
4pm is going to feel like it's Christmas again.
@RicheyRevol @stylishriot they were a good band. Never really understood why they were on Drive Thru Records.
@stylishriot @RicheyRevol their four track EP is great. Has an earlier, better version of Letters to You on it.
@lukedawson86 I go to AA because it's the same program as NA and there are none of them in Lynn anymore. Alcohol always starts the problem.
@RicheyRevol I told everyone at work about this tweet. They found it remarkable how accurately I come across on twitter.
@lukedawson86 did you just think of that off the top of your head? Bloody genius you are Trippy.
Nothing makes you more jealous of the unemployed then scraping ice off your van at 7am.
@hurst_craig @AaronMancz imagine wearing that much club shop attire over the age of ten. Such a strange man.
@markcarter1986 @spursycob just imagine if we did the league on our wage structure and our net spend though. It'd be something else.
@spursycob we'd be scarily good if we spent money.

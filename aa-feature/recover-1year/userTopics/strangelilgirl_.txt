Watching Supernatural. Not too shabby so far.
It will clear up until it's too late in the day/week fore to see a dr. Also, my back just cracked for the first time since surgery.

I made it through a house party sober. I wanted to cry at the end, but I made it.
@LeahBea_ aw, you should come over and we can bitch about guys together.
I'm thinking I may wind up strangling this kid before the night is over. No patience, and sobriety sucks when everyone else is drinking.
Dude, she's fucking using you. Why won't you ever get that through your head?
I'm going to try to make today a good day.
I'm beginning to think that a majority of my friends don't like me anymore.

@LeahBea_ I'm just too damn insecure. It's probably nothing, but I always fear the worst. See you Saturday?
I'm beginning to think you are hiding things from me again.
Wondering if my husband will ever come home. He's been gone all day.
Again, my life has turned into an endless cycle of doctors, psychiatrists, AA meetings, and anxiety all rolled into one. I wanna give up.
I sometimes feel like I need the voice of a friend. Talking to doctors and counselors and psychiatrists may not be enough.

Did you really just take the elevator to the second floor when the stairs were right next to it?!
Okay so, it is wrong to 1. Move a test 5 days earlier &amp; 2. Move it to the morning after the Super Bowl

Happy Birfffdayyy @bitsyknowsbesty! #onemoreyear #getcrazy 
@julianamarieh ooo kill em
@SeanHooper2 punk
Of course the one time I need to take a MWF 8am class and none are offered.
Sneezing after putting on mascara is one of the more frustrating things in life.
@KendallKnecht @its_savanna @SeanHooper2 hahah fair enough!
@SeanHooper2 @KendallKnecht @its_savanna waitttt what was the verdict?!  or 
@julianamarieh #NOTANEXCUSE
3 days into the semester and @julianamarieh already skipped her classes. I have one word for her: SLACK
@leewells21 oh lord, it better not be green!! But I might be going to myrtle

@kelseybell94 you're always my number 1 
I need a new drinking buddy. @SeanHooper2 has gone missing
@SeanHooper2 says the person who just got back to charleston after being gone for a month!
@FunNamePuns might be the best twitter account of all time 
I cannot believe we already got a house for next year... Is this real life?
@kelseybell94 but really... Dinner date one night this week! 
It's unfortunate that Charleston Restaurant week is about to start the time I'm the most broke.
@julianamarieh kill me 
Gilroys is the best place to people watch when you're not as blacked out as the people in it.
@SeanHooper2 @julianamarieh @its_savanna you love us
@its_savanna meehhh... I'll leave him with you then 
@its_savanna I'm taking Camden and were hiding somewhere else for the night. Good luck! 
To have my car in Charleston or to get a moped. Toughest decision ever 
@DainaChase kbye
@DainaChase no
@TWtyler7 I heard its a bad movie to see with parents. Good luck!
@kelseybell94 love you &amp; merry Christmas! 
@DainaChase: Shoutout to my sister for painting this! So artsy @ashleyhchase http://t.co/XG1ILID4V8 thanks girl 
@julianamarieh thank you Jesus 
I eat waaaay to much at home. It's time to be back at school on a broke college kid food budget.
@its_savanna @julianamarieh yum! Yes!! Only if we can get this!! http://t.co/qAM7yZc14g
If you make a big decision based on someone you are dating while you're young, then you're just dumb.
It doesn't even feel like Christmas time with this hot, rainy, gross weather.

After 5 finals, I am finally finished with this terrible semester!
Nothing better than girl talks to make everything better. Love my roommates.\n@julianamarieh and of curse @its_savanna!
Self control is waiting for your food to cool down so you don't burn your mouth.
My roommate is from Stratford &amp; it feels good to talk crap. #ProudAlumni
The library is so sad on a Friday night. Screw Saturday morning finals.
So my family treated themselves to sushi and fancy cupcakes tonight while I'm studying away in the library. Not fair 
@roseannchase7 
Finals should be renamed to Dementors. Like oh no, dementors are approaching, time to get our souls sucked out.
@WomensHumor: Nothing like studying for a final to make stripping not look like such a bad option after all. @julianamarieh
Successfully snuck into our dining hall for midnight breakfast. 
Java City, you never cease to disappoint me.
But seriously, that should've been on our maintanence man's top priority list today!!
Living without hot water makes me feel like I have no home.
Getting 3 A's on assignments has made this Monday after break a pretty good one.

Thank you professor for canceling out last class and last test and giving everyone a 93 for it instead 
Can today be over so I can sleep forever?
@its_savanna one day.....
He way @its_savanna is talking to her dog right now makes me want to barf. Haha

I said I was done with this semester a while ago, but after today I have never meant it more.

@SeanHooper2 all from different masters?
Savanna got in trouble at the library. We obviously can't take her anywhere.
Why yes make a long, loud phone call inside the library. There's no other place you could possibly do this.
@kelseybell94 we gotta make a living in college somehow!

Registering for classes is more stressful than it should be.
I just love it when all the classes I want to register for are at the same time 
Glad my 9 and 10 am classes were both canceled but really wish my 10 am professor would have told us before we showed up to class 
And let @julianamarieh birthday festivities begin!
@margaretculp that's doing it right 
Nope. @julianamarieh http://t.co/VmvS6rrKWJ
Second week in a row I've skipped all my classes on Friday. Oh well 3 day weekends for me!
I want it to be Halloween again 
Everyone who is dressed up tonight and going out, I dislike y'all.
@margaretculp @DainaChase get in the car and come!!!
@DainaChase 
@DainaChase told you to come to charleston, but ya never listen!
So mad I have not being able to enjoy Halloweek because my teacher assigned an Ochem exam on Halloween 
Handwashed all of our pots and pans yesterday and the pile is already back in the sink... like really?
Having your professor forget to subtract 11 of the points you missed is the best luck ever. Thank you 
The only committed relationship I want to be in for a while is with my bed.
@julianamarieh when's your birthday?
It's annoying how we overlook other people's mistakes all the time, but when we make one we get judged for it.
Ooops....
I'm craving CiCis for some reason. Weird
BASSNECTAR WAS SICK
@margaretculp I MISS YOU !!!
@SeanHooper2 let's plan a weekend trip.
on a positive note, if this test doesn't go well, there's still always food and alcohol. so I'm a winner either way.
@TWtyler7 stud
That someone also got me stuck in the revolving doors at the library...
Someone's feet here smell really bad...
Getting my ass handed to me by college one day at a time.
@julianamarieh possibly the best tweet ever. So true.
Is it grey or gray? Does anyone actually know or is the whole world just guessing?
Can it be next semester already? I need a fresh start with my classes.
I still have no idea what my history professor rambles about, and I don't think he does either...
You're never given a dream without also being given the power to make it true.
School is hard.

\"You know how I know I'm drunk? I walked into a closet instead of the bathroom\" -@SeanHooper2
I feel more judged being dressed up for class than I do when I bum it.
My speech for class was actually perfect for once until I awkwardly hiccup/burped in the middle of it 
Why am I just now finding out about Parks and Recreation?! Best show ever!
@SeanHooper2 dammit. I wish I would've saw this earlier!!
@julianamarieh okay mom.
Why stress over the future, when you're living in the present? This is when life is happening.
Just saw a girl hoarding a bunch of cupcakes from City Bistro and it reminded me of @bstallworths and I last year. 
Happiness isn't about getting what you want all the time, it's about loving what you have.
@kelseybell94 is one to talk. #perfectbody #cootiewithabootie
I go to Starbucks to finally try a PSL and then realize I'm a broke college student and settle for iced coffee. 
@kelseybell94 LOL 
I kind of miss having a meal plan.
@DainaChase you're the best student council officer ever!
@DainaChase how do you make holy water? You burn the hell out of it.
Losing 1 point because my critical review was too uncritical but losing 3 points because my title was missing 1 word... What?
@DainaChase why do Eskimos was their closes in ride? Because its too cold out tide.
@DainaChase you're the dumbest joke.
How do you catch a unique rabbit? Unique up on it. How do you catch a tame rabbit? Tame way.
When will people realize that it is unnecessary to post every specific thing that happens each day to them?
@8_Semesters: Getting real fucking tired of having to put on pants everyday. @bstallworths would retweet this.
The sad part is I actually understand and like ochem, I just don't want to put the effort in to study.
Live by the currents. Plan by the tides. Follow the sun.
With this weather, I just want to lay in my eno all day.
Why can't I just skip to the part where I am really rich, own a yacht, and travel the world?

I don't think you can ever truly appreciate you're family until you're away from them.
I still have not installed the iOS7
@kelseybell94 Hahaha yeah that was me. Most embarrassing thing ever! I miss you too!
Now to drown my sorrows from all the bad luck I've been having, it's time for Taco Bell!
Ran out of gas on the cooper river bridge and had a cop car push me across. Yup, that just happened.
Today's weather makes me just want to stay in bed all day.
It just doesn't seem right that my life applies more to @MensHumor than @WomensHumor...
Waiting for all this bad luck to finally stop.
@kelseybell94 haha seriously we are on the same page. Just thinking the same thing!
@kelseybell94 ahhh me either!!!! But I'm so tired!!

Holy fall, where did this cold come from?!
@RileyKneiding ah! I love your comforter! Where'd you get it?!
Procrastinating studying for anatomy was possibly the dumbest decision of my life.
People suck at walking today.
Why is my history class such a waste of time?!
Getting stuck in an elevator.. Starting Friday the 13th out right!
It honestly feels like when everything is going perfect in my life, something happens to mess it up.

@julianamarieh @its_savanna shit just got real. #dontmesswithcumden
@holly_margaret @its_savanna SMOOTHIE PARTY
None of the things my history professor says relates to the things he said before... Or even the topic of the class.
@its_savanna spinach?! All together?!
@SeanHooper2 cool

Did my drink really just explode on me in class?

@SeanHooper2 hates me and won't visit me in Charleston
@bstallworths I haven't stopped crying since you left Charleston 
@bstallworths I'm going to go with the \"I do not miss you\" reaction!
@bstallworths ...or the fact that I was with you 24/7 for a whole year!!
The night that never ended... @its_savanna
@DainaChase you can sleep and watch gossip girl at the same time?! Pretty impressive.
@margaretculp @DainaChase y'all come soon!!
@DainaChase by coming to stay with me soon!!
The worlds a maze and I cant find the center of truth, my mind wont let me loose, I'm constricted by the distant roots.

I kind of wish I was going home for the summer, but at the same time I can't imagine a better way to spend it than in Charleston.
My suitemate thinks Burger King is better than Taco Bell! I always knew there was something super weird about her...
I like how @bstallworths can't give me a compliment without throwing an insult in it.
Lobster status.
I'm watching this documentary that makes absolutely no sense because I'm that good of a suitemate  @bstallworths
@bstallworths: Well fuck. Life should definitely have an 'I was drunk can we all completely forget that now' button life story!
@BLFender22 ew stop! But city bistro is having bacon day/week or something!
But I mean what student wouldn't want an ice cream sandwich with candy bacon in it....?
Last class of freshman year. It is crazy how time flies.
Dear Lord, give me the strength to make it through these 3 tests today!
My life is a serious mess right now. I need summer 
Excited to watch my high school team play tonight! #GoodLuckLadies @NHSTrojanSB
@julianamarieh 4 shoo. 4 real though, We are done with that class 4ever. Thankful 4 that!
@julianamarieh ..and we ask ourselves what's wrong with us 
@julianamarieh same thing just happened to me. Mine was more like saying hey after he had passed... 
Bailey is the definition of a diva when she's sick. 
@ShtNo1SaysCofC: The nicer it is outside the more likely I am to go to class @julianamarieh
So I don't know what's more boring: this class or the conversations people have in here.

Here we go back, this is the moment, tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over.
Rarely went to class, and still made higher than the honors students on the test. 
@bitsycreecher &lt;3 you! That just means a free trip to Charleston for you!
@its_savanna @julianamarieh stop! It is not, it's just the best reason!

Thinking a test is a later date than it really is, is possibly one of the most disappointing feeling.

Already considering sleeping all weekend. #exhausted
Waking up wouldn't be that bad if I could just snap my fingers and instantly be ready.

@SeanHooper2: Any chance there'll be something fun going on in Rock Hill next week when I'm home? What a dumb question.

Seriously rain, GTFO.
If I fall along the way, pick me up and dust me off. And if I get too tired to make it, be my breath so I can walk.
Bailey needs to quit bragging, some people have sisters who show their love in other ways, like by not sending them gifts...  #subtweet

HELLO BASEBALL SEASON 
When the gym is completely empty and that one other person picks the treadmill right next to you 
The fact that my high school team had their first scrimmage today &amp; I'm not playing any more is possibly the saddest realization ever.
\"What's a boberry biscuit?\" -bailey. \n I just don't understand her sometimes..

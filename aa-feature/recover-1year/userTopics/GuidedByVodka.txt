Holy shit @normmacdonald is tweeting one of his longform Twitter stories and it is fucking poetry.
On my laptop it's blue and black. On my phone it's gold and white. Am simultaneously more and less confused.
@gabeliedman @JoeMande How is he not curious about the origin of the name Science Hill? What sort of hill does science?
I think that @ChuckCJohnson is the evil version of @CKlosterman only you can't tell because their beards cover the evil mustache on Johnson

@Notsewfast Had Comcast for a week. 5 different issues. Worst company of all time.
In football a touchdown is 6 pts, a field goal is 3, a safety is 2, and rape is \"off field issues\".

I like to imagine the Viagra boner pep talk lady is directly addressing the Trivago dude.
@DufresneLATimes Wait, I thought we just beat a top 10 team on the road. Other schools celebrate these things.
@Godsauce \"Need You Tonight\" by iNXS. I sang it once and it ended up creepy as fuck!

I get why people make fun of Simmons, but I still dig his stuff. More concerned that if he leaves ESPN, Grantland suffers. #FreeSimmons
This Survivor cast (besides Rocker obvs) seems remarkably likeable. Not surprised as every a-hole on earth is currently appearing on Utopia.
@EllenBarkin Straight fire.
@BMcCarthy32 Been great to have my favorite Twitter follow on my favorite team in sports since I was wee. Come back, Brandon!

@monteiro Great film if for no other reason than Sal's pronunciation of \"pizzeria\"
@Godsauce \"Surprisingly good\" is a pretty apt description of \"Arrow\".
Biggest difference in 20s me and 30s me is 20s me went to movies ALL the time. Saw \"Nell\" in the theater for fucks sake. NELL.
@JPosnanski Not unless a band records a song titled \"We Just Won The Title Game(s) of Our Sports League\"

PSA: To all Tour De Franzia participants. Just a reminder to be at my house by 11:45 saturday and to bring your OWN 3L box of wine (not 5.)
Relationships where ya gotta contemplate if there's enough time to go pull a quickie in the bathroom restaurant while you wait 4 your food &gt;
Cmon errybody. Swear, post about drugs and being drunk. Lets revolutionize this shitty business world to become more realistic

Highthoughts are the worst when you're just tryna chill and not have any thoughts whatsoever #HighThoughts
I wonder if people that study politics wait 4 years just to talk about politics for a few months. Kinda like the olympics for nafs cha feel?
Of all people, social media is not a way to keep up with me. If you do that, your gonna end up assuming i do drugs and drink alcohol a lot.
I mean it's not a zombie apocalypse, but it'll have to do #Trump2k16
Grow the fuck up people. Stop acting like grown children.

Moral of the story: pay your tab separately when no one else is around
I went on a mission to find my waiter, got $7 back, then ordered another drink w/ it
I was about to start throwing backhands at everyone in the bar i swear
Never trusting a girl w/ my tip again... the tab was $11..  i paid w/ a 20.... and this sally told her to "keep the change"
Really gotta stop hitting the bars on the weekdays
Wish it was sunday again so i could sleep all day, again.

@marcuszapata_ I don't believe in deleting tweets. But I'd delete this one just because it seems kind of odd to tweet such a thing
Hit up Hailey for the party tonight if you tryna get your drank on at the U
But I've come to learn. None of you can handle the actual truth. You see honesty and blame that person for being honest.
Ugh, sometimes I wanna say some of the realest shit on here, cuz that's usually what i tweet about
Need me a girl I can party with but remember it's okay to stay in some nights n roll up n chill
Thank god for commission tho. Never made a dub an hour before. But I can dig it.

"Keep a sober clear mind" they said. Pfft, or stay lit for 2 days straight. Pick your poison
That's me tho. Ladies, im sure that's the equivalent of 20 gallons of rocky road ice cream
After personal research. Ive learned it takes roughly 2 cases of cheap beer a bottle of karkov and 2 bottles of Henny to get over a break up
@THELAMKIN94 bro, it's different out here in MN. The whole state would team up and riot my ass lmao

@THELAMKIN94 hahaha dats what I'm here for :)
Just wait for the next time I wanna troll and see how many of yall I could get to unfollow me. I'm shootin for the stars, like 40+
Fuck you for reading this
You're all adults. You choose what you read and don't. You can't read a novel then dislike the fact you read it. You just put the book down
Like how can one judge what a person tweets? Then talk about what is right/wrong?
Who's to judge what can or cannot be said on here? I thought the point of Twitter was to express what's on your mind?
@marcuszapata_ thanks dude
Almost took down to 2 cases yesterday but I pussied out and fell asleep or something? Idk
Aight q. Dont hook it up with another sunny day of PTO. 2 days was lit enough for me

I bet some of yall ofWould love to come at my life. But you dont cuz you know idgaf and that I know things you don't want ppl to know
S/O to dowma for giving me a new bad ass knife in case I end up in situation where it would be needed
Not saying I'm the best human. But I can point out a piece of shit in a heartbeat
I judge everyone by what they say and the lies they speak. Lowkey. Which is why I know who's  a good human and who's not
Never understood why someone would come at me and not expect me to defend myself?
Better get off twitter now because I know too many facts that would fuck up toooo much shit.
@OGgarebear oh right. You told me your life story. I could go on about your depression story but im gonna stop now. Cuz I like I &amp; u made me

Don't get it twisted. I'm a very chill person. But if you do me wrong and/or lie deadass to my face . I will treat you like dirt
Worst is when you straight up ask a person about a situation and they lie. Those are the worst kinds of humans
@marcuszapata_ act like these were deleted.
@marcuszapata_ aka Hailey is cuz she doesn't want "someone" to be mad at her
@marcuszapata_ ppl already getting mad at me  about this even tho I didn't do anything.
@Hailz_16 @oh_haaiii_ley I feel it .never really been the type of person to feed and enjoy off another's misfortune. Maybe that's just me
@oh_haaiii_ley a person's life and feelings is not just an entertainment Hailey
How clownin would it be if I made my new avi of the pic I got of Joey and Hailey in bed together?
Had her stitch my heart back together. But I guess I'm missing too many pieces
@marcuszapata_ it'd be sooo funny and truthful. But sooo many ppl will get butthurt
@marcuszapata_ will reveal the secret later. Currently still letting my point prove itself

@lenncoco @BlakedaBearJew hit me with the deets if you find one!

Technically I wouldn't say im bad like that either. But I'd say I fall more on the shaded side of the gray area, if that make sense?

Wonder if I could get hypnotherapy to help me forget ever watching Dexter and HIMYM so could do it all over again :)
I only tweet a lot sometimes to annoy you
I learned a valuable lesson today. Mixing a 5 hour energy and a monster energy drink is a huge no no
When you kill your math final drunk and without studying because you actually applied yourself and learned all semester
1 final murdered, one more to fuck up
Dang. Tried wishing for weed again but the chilly is keeshed :/
Yall had me lowkey thinking I was gonna be stressed on my finals day the way yall tweet about it. But lowkey I dont see why? It's been chill
The trick up my sleeve consists of a 5 hour energy, a Monster, a chili cheese dog, and actually studying instead of napping
Just to keep you all up to date. School is currently kicking my ass in today's battle so far. But, I have a trick up my sleeve.
THANK MUTHA FUCKING BABY JESUS I PICKED UP MY CHILLUM WISHING I HAD WEED ONLY TO REALIZE I GOT TOO CHOPPED YESTERDAY AND FORGOT SHE'S PACKED
@ItsRealJenna A's get 6 figures tho
Only God know why I turn my key towards the closest doorframe to unlock my door...
If you read my tweets and say, "oooh he fell off, tf happened to him?"You're exactly where I want your fake ass to be lol
I hate when ppl say "college isnt my thing"  like BRUH! I literally don't go to class and can pull a B average out of my ass. FOH w/ dat boi
Tips to myself for next semester of college. Don't take 3 weeks off of school for "spring break" before you're actual spring break
Taking an L will fucc your day up
Who are you voting for prez?
Don't know how well my dumb luck will pay off today... but #FingersCrossed
Got up, railed 3 shots back to back. One for each final today that I should've been studying for all week
See peeps, I can be thoughtful..  sometimes
You ever wake up next to your significant other and have to resist the urge to tear their clothes off so they can get their beauty sleep?

@FruTegomoh so does eric church and toby keith...
@FruTegomoh he raps about peace, love, and not showering
@FruTegomoh nahhh boi you dont know what you're talking about
@FruTegomoh neither am i. But comparing wiz to mod sun is like comparing beyonce to lorde
Sometimes wish i grew up in the hood so itd be easier to drop out and get rich selling crack on the streets
@FruTegomoh nah its hippy music. If you bout that 1970s peace and love stuff you'd enjoy it.
@FruTegomoh highly offended by this. Have you ever listened to his music?

All I need is some bars and 4/20 would be complete #SikeNigga

S/o to g pens for helping a nigga stay lifted at times where it would have been inappropriate to smell like reefer or pull out a rig n torch
Remembering things is much easier when one of your walls in your bedroom is a chalkboard
Vodka and dabs will have to do I guess...
Whiskey &amp; weed would be clutch rn
Pulled an all nighter watching Netflix #Swag
Everyone craves to be successful, but fail to realize all it takes is the investment of their own time. You choose at what age it happens by
Still waiting for the next shitty rapper to blow up just because he made a cool "dab" remix

@FruTegomoh gotta make her a lil cloudy like the true OG's do
@marcuszapata_ yet them same girls be feminists making statuses about how cat-calling makes them feel inhumane/disrespected/uncomfortable
@marcuszapata_ seriously, yall ever read the comments on a girls photo. Like 20 girls be commenting like, "nice ass" "peep those titties"
Back in my day, guys could talk/flirt with girls. Nowadays you better have a vagina to tell a girl she pretty or else you're a thirsty creep
Luv only having class on Mondays &amp; Wednesdays &lt;3  #ScheduleMaster #DrunkOnAWednesday #WellTechnicallyThursdayNow :))))))
Chances are you watch my snap stories, but I don't watch yours :D
Someone spot me $30k so I can buy this maserati. Will pay back in sexual favors ;)
@_emilyturnerr Always have been :)
&amp; I don't mean gay people are lame. But like, I mean they like penis's, which from my opinion Id consider it lame to be infatuated w/ such
Not like it's literally "gay" but more like lame as hell
But then again, school is gay &amp; so is studying.
Idk why, but I started doing better in school when I stopped going to class and studying the textbook instead
@_emilyturnerr Emily your a good girl, you don't take synthetics lol
Weird I'm learning something in class and I haven't even taken an Addy yet today... #SoooWeird
@_03Ariii I never said I don't tip good servers. Hence why I said I hate when they think they are "entitled" to a tip for doing nothing
@_03Ariii all I'm saying is servers shouldn't expect tips unless they do their job right. Not bring me food and check back in an hour.
@_03Ariii ehhh, yeah I don't think that's gonna stop me. The restaurant industry should focus on fixing this issue with tipping.
@_03Ariii exactly my point. If they do their job correctly they do. But they are not "entitled" to a tip for bringing me food and that's it.
@_03Ariii but if no one tips then your checks would be regular sized right?
@shermanchar02 do you tip your uber ever?!?!
@marcuszapata_ real shit. Like if you want a tip, you better be damn near eating my food with me otherwise imma just just round up to the $1
I hate how waiters feel "entitled" to get a tip for a job that they are already getting paid for doing. Just grinds the fuck outta my gears.
@svennythelegend such a great feeling :)
Whoops! Just spilled half of my Addy and my roommate's parents' cat ate it....
Yall probs don't fux wit Cam Meekins but I fux wit his music heavy

Just saw a bitch @ century wearing a shirt that said 'Take me to Paris' ... I have no words right now...
Two types of people: people that do there homework, and people that go to the library
Anyone else notice a resemblance between Wiz's Bake Sale and GEazy's Order More?
You ain't balled on a budget unless you shop at Aldi's
Turkey bacon, adderal, and vodka is the new breakfast of champions
The fact that I'm making turkey bacon w/ breakfast rn because it's cheaper then regular bacon... Absolutely disgusts me

@oh_haaiii_ley its the breakfast of champions
@oh_haaiii_ley I mean if you dance on a table tonight for me we could find out if I would or nah
On the other hand. I woke up sleazy, chugged a glass of wine, puked, smoked weed, and now I'm ready to rage
Hailey's mad at me for feeding the girl dancing on the table my last dollar using my mouth. She claims, "you wouldn't give me a dollar!"
@jimmymoney_ you have the worst luck with phones...
I never got how girls can kiss their friends. If any of my homies tried to kiss me they'd  be catching an uppercut without thought

@oh_haaiii_ley I didn't want to lie. Honest Esteban has never told a lie
Got high and biked 4.1 miles through the snow to school.... Worst decision I've made in a while #WeedIsBad
Idk if there's a better way to state the point of a college degree if you ask me. Lmk if you have something better
People ask why college? What's the point? There isn't. You're basically paying for a bigger and better sign on your head that says "pick me"
Woke up 3 hours before my 9am cuz I'm so fricken stoked for school! Maybe I should get a little sleazy first ;)
Scrolling through Facebook seeing all these people in relationships like...."Ayy me too, that's wassup!"
Nothing worse then being up $500 dollars in blackjack and I end up leaving with the $20 I started... So damn frustrating !
@marcuszapata_ woke up to this. MLK day is lit
Pretty damn lucky if you'd ask me :)
Woke up sleazy. How lucky am I to move into a house where the owner just so happens to be a stoner &amp; fully functioning alcoholic
If only I would have known all my roommates would be gone all weekend ahead of time... Coulda prepared a party for y'all :/
@marcuszapata_ that way we both will learn lessons the hard way lol
The day a person tells me I'm not hired for a job because of social media.. Imma literally put baby powder on my hand and slap tf outta them

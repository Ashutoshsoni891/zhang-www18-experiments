@Lesism   no they don't.  
tomorrow I am having xmas lunch at work. Merry Christmas.
Ran 15 km. I am so proud.
Today did all the things I need to do, to function OK. I went running this afternoon and I did an AA meeting in the evening.
@AlcoholFreeDays I started running the moment I stopped drinking. Doesn't cost a thing.
@AlcoholFreeDays good for you.
@AlcoholFreeDays that is my feer too. It took me several weeks to get sober. But my brains does not remember that as being difficult.
I'm tired, so terrible tired. It's not even six o'clock and I think I'm going to sleep.
My twitter account is leading a life of its own. I am following all kinds of strangers.
@AlcoholFreeDays well,I suppose that was the only right thing to do. Good for you.
@agentlochhead I am there with you. Keep on the good work.
@AlcoholFreeDays well, just keep that in mind on a bad day.
Today, it is exactly two years ago I had my last drink.
Afraid a new depression knocked on my door.
@AlcoholFreeDays ..welldone, keep up the good work.
I found a pimple on my chin. Ha, Still very youthful..
today celebrated my birthday. I am going to sleep one year older (and more wise)  ;-)
just returned from a AA meeting. A bit emotional it was.
@AlcoholFreeDays I am learning about my weaknesses.. I know i do have some.
She said alcoholics are the most stupid people she knew. Ouch, that hurt.
I was listening to a loud conversation a girl had in the train. She was a social worker and works with alcoholics.
I am the lucky owner of a psychic indication. Is my life over or does it start here?
@AlcoholFreeDays and make all the same mistakes?
What the f........
I am week, don't know what decision to make.
Trainer wants to speak with me. Now what to do.
I quit my running group. Now what to do.
Did not sleep last night. Still worried about my ruining group.
running group fell apart. Now I feel like I am on my own.
I can't find my glasses anywhere. I'm afraid I put them in my washing machine. At least they will be clean in a moment.
I have been in recovery for almost two year. When can I say I'm recovered.
@AlcoholFreeDays yes you (we) are ;-)
Forgot my key for my bicycle, had to walk to work. With new shoes that was not very nice. Blisters and pain.
Had a difficult evening Friday. I took a sleeping pill to avoid a relapse.
North sea jazz festival. Bobby Womack, Bonnie Rusty and Sting. That was a good combo.
Running keeps my mind from wandering all over the place.
started my first roparun training today.
today finally a sunny day. The idea alone makes me happy.
ran this morning 10 km. in 1 hour and 45 sec. Doing better and better. ;-)
yesterday three new faces at the AA meeting. Hopefully they find what they need.
Step 8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.
@AlcoholFreeDays question is: should you start count all over from 1. Those first days still count. Do they?

Told you I'm jealous of her and what do u do? Go out for supper, give her a ride to the meeting. ..maybe it's ridiculous but maybe ...
Can't control my thoughts.They're worst cuz I feel like shit. Lemme go back to sleep and forget about this for a few hours. Before she texts
It's only professional. ...sure. But my mind is going crazy.  I know she's easy..
So insecure...He says don't be...it's not that easy when you say you don't like her but act like you do.
Jai jamais ete manger Au Madison moi...jaimerais bien que @Metalliclaw  m'y amene Un jour

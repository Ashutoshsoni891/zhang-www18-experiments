@errantEmber So much better. We've grown. From everything we've had to go through.
Okay, if you're knowingly spreading false information about hurricane Irma, what kind of shitstain -are- you?
@errantEmber But I'm so glad I did. Because look at us now.
@errantEmber No. I wanted us to work on it. Because I...didn't know if I could save us alone.
@errantEmber I meant it the day I married you. And I don't break promises.
@errantEmber You won't. Not ever.
@errantEmber Made sure I made the right decisions. Gave up the shit that was bad for me.
@errantEmber I need you too. [he rubbed a thumb into her back, closing his eyes.] You've saved me so many times.
@errantEmber [he snorted, leaning in to press their foreheads together.] I'm glad that change wasn't wanting to become single.
@errantEmber I ran away for six months. If there's anything I would change, it would be that.
@errantEmber Thank you for putting up with me. And everything I put you through.
@errantEmber [she stayed after he ran away for six months. he nodded, glancing up to meet her eyes.] I'm so lucky.
@errantEmber [he sighed shakily, leaning in close.] I dunno. Really?
@errantEmber I really don't know what I would do without you, Emily.
@errantEmber [he twisted his fingers in her shirt, sighing slowly as he calmed down.]
@errantEmber [he didn't want Emily to go anywhere. he shook his head, scooting closer to her.] No.
@errantEmber [he was so glad she thought so, that him tripping over his issues didn't put them in jeopardy.] I love you.
@errantEmber [he sniffed, wiping at his eyes.] I know. I know, Em. I just want to be the best for him. And you. Both of you.
@errantEmber [a sob broke in his chest as he leaned into her, closing his eyes.] Im so fucking glad you think so.
@errantEmber him up. Because he's the best thing, Em. He's incredible.
@errantEmber I know. [he sniffed, placing the beer down and wiping at his eyes.] I know, and I'm so glad he does, that I haven't fucked --
@errantEmber full time. [he sniffed, tears coming to his eyes.] Fuck, Em.
@errantEmber Everything that you do. Being here for Si. Being a mom, looking after me, working far more than --
@errantEmber [something shifted in his chest and he swallowed hard, squeezing her hand.] I don't know how you do it.
@errantEmber Yeah. Just...work, and shit like that. [he had been feeling a little worn down.]
@errantEmber Yeah, well. [he took a long sip of beer, sighing.]
@errantEmber He's not happy about it.
@errantEmber He wouldn't calm down. Being a terror. So he went to bed early.
@errantEmber You're fine. And bedtime came a bit early today.
@errantEmber Hi, baby. [he kissed the top of her head.] Go back to sleep.
@errantEmber [he crawls into bed next to her, pile of paperwork deposited on the desk and beer in hand.]
Kids are exhausting. I need a drink.
Yeah, yeah, Da is a big old meanie. I'll see you tomorrow, Si.
I'm dead serious. Momma will kiss you when she wakes up but you are going to bed Simon Bernard.
Okay, that's it. Bedtime. -Now-, mister.
Simon Bernard, I'm not joking. Be quiet, or I'm gonna put you in your room.
I know she's been sleeping for a while. But she's healing, okay?
Simon, kid. You gotta calm down. Momma is trying to sleep.
@errantEmber Good thing I love you so much.
@errantEmber God, we're disgusting.
@errantEmber Thank god that you do. Woulda gotten so lost without you.
@errantEmber [he laughed softly, careful to not disturb the sleeping toddler.]
@errantEmber Don't know how I found you. Don't know what I would do without you.
@errantEmber [he sighs slowly, pulling her closer.] Love you.
@errantEmber [Clint nodded, kissing the top of her head.] Here. Medication.
@errantEmber Hey, no. It's okay. Like I said, I would rather have you here than more kids. I would be a terrible single dad.
@errantEmber [he squeezed her shoulder, those words meaning more to him than she realized.] You two are my world.
@errantEmber I'm really fucking glad you think so, Em.
@errantEmber [he grins, passing her the water bottle and one of the pills.] I just want to give him the best of me.
@errantEmber Yeah? He does? [he settlers next to her, pulling her close.]
@errantEmber [Clint smiles softly at that, sitting back down.] I know. He's the best kid.
@errantEmber [he comes back a few minutes later, reaching across to put the toast on the bedside table.] He loves you so much, Em.
@errantEmber Yeah. [he kisses her forehead before kissing the back of Si's head, moving slowly.]
@errantEmber Yeah. Of course. What do you want to eat with it?
@errantEmber [he woke quickly, rubbing his eyes and smiling as he sees Si fast asleep.] Hey.
@errantEmber Momma's cooking is magical.
@errantEmber ["Yes!"] Was Gram's cooking good?
@errantEmber [Clint laughs softly, kissing Emily.] Yeah. It's different.
@errantEmber So you absolutely are. [he kisses Si's cheek before blowing a raspberry.]
@errantEmber [he rubs his back and kisses his temple.] You're such a Momma's boy.
@errantEmber [he smiles as Si reaches up to wrap his arms around her neck.] Easy, bud. Careful.
@errantEmber I would too. Both of you.
@errantEmber I think little man may want to sleep with us tonight.
@errantEmber He's so happy to see you.
@errantEmber It's amazing. Still can't thank you enough, baby.
@errantEmber [he smiles softly and takes her hand, squeezing it once before shifting and pulling out.]
@errantEmber [he smiles softly at her as he closes the door, sliding into the driver's side.]
@errantEmber [he opens the door for her, ready to help as she lowers herself into the car.]
@errantEmber [he reaches to squeeze her hand before moving.]
@errantEmber It's at your mom's.
@errantEmber [he smiled and kissed her cheek.] Wanna take the Dodge?
@errantEmber [he grabs a jacket for her, draping it over her shoulders.]
@errantEmber Your mom has been texting me - he misses you too.
@errantEmber Ready to go pick up the monster?
@errantEmber Yeah. I'll make you an English muffin - you need to take it with food.
@errantEmber [he set the kettle on the stove, pulling out her medication and placed them in front of her.]
@errantEmber [he pressed a long kiss to her forehead before standing, going to make tea.]
@errantEmber I'm always here for you. You want any tea or anything?
@errantEmber [he presses his lips to her hand.] I love you.
@errantEmber Yeah. I need to be here, I think.
@WelcomeToLevel7 TXT: oh, man. I would love anything and everything.
@WelcomeToLevel7 TXT: I would really appreciate that. I don't know if Emily would be up for it but Si would like to see you.
@WelcomeToLevel7 TXT: it's, I mean, it's not okay, but I'm glad Emily is safe and okay.
@WelcomeToLevel7 TXT: so, uh, you're still an uncle, but no new little one.
Taking the rest of the week off. Gotta focus on home right now.
@errantEmber [he tangled his fingers in her hair, sighing.] It's okay, baby.
@errantEmber I love you too, Emily. More than I can really express.
@errantEmber You mom is gonna tell him. I rushed right here.
@errantEmber No. I mean, he's three. I didn't think he would understand.
@errantEmber I called her right after you called me. Si's having a sleepover at her place.
@errantEmber [Clint wasn't sure what to say, electing to continue to rub his hand down her back.]
@errantEmber [he sighed and moved so he was sitting on the bed, pulling her close.]
@errantEmber I love you, Emily. So much, okay?
@errantEmber Give it a little, okay? You're gonna be feeling those pain meds soon. [he brushed a stray piece of hair out of her face.]
@errantEmber Hi, Em. [he takes her hand, entwining their fingers together and squeezing.]
@errantEmber nurse, nerves tight in his stomach.]
@errantEmber [Clint hadn't been able to stop worrying, twisting his hands every five seconds. he stood and followed the --
@errantEmber [he kisses her softly.] I love you. I promise, it's okay.
@errantEmber It's okay. Honestly, sweetheart. I would rather you be here and okay than have more kids.
@errantEmber Sssh, hey. It's okay. [he rubbed a hand down her back, closing his eyes.]
@errantEmber It's not your fault. Not at all. Just bad timing. Wasn't meant to be.
@errantEmber [he breathed out slow, closing his eyes.] Its gonna be okay, Em.
@errantEmber [this was terrible. he pressed his hand to her stomach, sighing slowly.] When are you going into surgery?
@errantEmber [he wraps her in a gentle hug, forehead on her shoulder.] How are you feeling?
@errantEmber [he rushes in a few minutes later, flustered.] Hey, baby.
@errantEmber TXT: five minutes. finding parking.
It's...listen, Emily is sick, I have to go.
I gotta go, guys. I'll see you later.
@errantEmber I'll see you soon. [he hung up the phone, taking a second to breathe before calling Ruth.]
@errantEmber No promises on speeding, baby. I love you so much, okay?
@errantEmber [he felt the blood drain from his face and his stomach clench.] Fuck. I'll be right there.
@errantEmber Yes. Of course. Give me fifteen minutes and I'll be right there.
@errantEmber Emily? [he frowned, unsure what was going on.] What's wrong?
@errantEmber [he steps away from his meeting, answering the unknown number.] Barton.
@errantEmber TXT: got caught up in a bunch of work shit. take a bunch of pictures for me and I'll see you tonight
@errantEmber [he grins and winks at her as he picks up his bag.] Love you both.
@errantEmber I'll figure something out. Either way, text me what happens.
@errantEmber [he rubs his hand down her back before stepping away.] See you at three.
@errantEmber [he grins, leaning in to kiss her.] Okay. I have to go to work, I'm already late. I'll see you later today?
@errantEmber I mean, I'm kinda attached to you.
@errantEmber [leans down to kiss her forehead, placing a hand in her belly.]
@errantEmber Let me see what's going on at work and I'll let you know.
@errantEmber Do you want me to take a late lunch and go with you?
@errantEmber When is your doctors appointment?
@errantEmber I love you, sweetheart.
@errantEmber Sure thing, baby.
@errantEmber Milk and sugar in your tea?
@errantEmber Do you want anything else to eat?
@errantEmber Just okay? Do you want some tea?
@errantEmber How are my little ones feeling?
@errantEmber No -ma'am-. [he grins and leans in to kiss her.]
@errantEmber Up to you, baby.
@errantEmber Coulda put dinner on hold if you had told me.
@errantEmber Yeah? [he grinned, pulling her closer.] All day?
@errantEmber [he dropped his fork, adjusting a bit as he sank his hands into Emily's hair.]
@errantEmber [he smiled, leaning in to kiss her firmly.]
@errantEmber I mean, you might be a -little- biased.
@errantEmber Chef's okay. [he smirked.]
@errantEmber Good, I'm glad you like it. [he kissed her temple before taking a bite.]
@errantEmber Always. [he smiled, leaning closer to her.] I love you, Emily. To the moon and back and all that other junk.
@errantEmber Well, things are working out. Well. -Really- well, for us.
@errantEmber I mean, I'm excited to have another kid.
@errantEmber [he wrapped an arm around her shoulders, sighing as she moved closer.]
@errantEmber Four buck chucks, baby. [he smiled as he sat, winking at her.]
@errantEmber Oh, cmon, you know what you're doing. [he leaned in to kiss her.] C'mon, let's eat.
@errantEmber It's not the worst wine I've ever had. But I also know nothing about wine, so.
@errantEmber Cheers, Missus Barton-Moore. [he clinks his glass against hers before taking a sip.]
@errantEmber [he set two bowls on the table, moving to kiss her cheek as she opened the bottle.] Love you.
@errantEmber Yeah. I got red. And I hope it's good.
@errantEmber Yeah. Go get us some wine and I'll start plating stuff.
@errantEmber Another little us. [he couldn't help but be excited, unable to tame the giddiness in his chest.]
@errantEmber [he smiled and rubbed his hand down her arm.] Gonna be a Momma again.
@errantEmber Wow, leaving work. That's exciting. [he teased gently, grinning.]
@errantEmber What time is your appointment?
@errantEmber Well, our lives are going to get crazier soon. [he brushed his fingers over her belly.] Thought we should have one last night.
@errantEmber [he smiled as he kissed her back, wrapping an arm around her waist.]
@errantEmber Shrimp scampi with some vegetables. And some amazing non-alcoholic wine.
@errantEmber [he glanced up and smiled softly.] Hey, baby.

@errantEmber I'm so excited for us. [he rubbed a thumb into her back, signing.] I love you, you're amazing.
@errantEmber No, no. Of course not. But. [he can't stop grinning, unable to wipe the smile off his face.]
@errantEmber I'm so fucking happy. [he leans in to kiss her firmly.] Another little one. Si's gonna be a big brother.
@errantEmber That's...shit, Em. That's amazing! [he grins, wrapping his arms around her waist.]

@errantEmber You're working on it:
@errantEmber You've been a great wife.
@errantEmber Well, you're an amazing lady and a great mom.
@errantEmber Of course - you're a perfectionist. I wouldn't expect anything less.
@errantEmber How is it going?
@errantEmber We should get away sometime soon.
@errantEmber I love you.
@morningbrings That wasn't the plan?
@errantEmber I guess I like it enough.
@errantEmber I guess I like it enough.

@morningbrings Have you seen you? You're pretty cute, too.
@errantEmber Ew, gross, you like me. [he grinned and winked, leaning in to kiss her again.]

@morningbrings Aaah, 's okay, I guess. [he smirks, kissing her cheek.]
@errantEmber [he nods, kissing her cheek before moving to pour two cups.]

@morningbrings That sounds ideal.
@errantEmber I just had a long fucking day:
@morningbrings Thank god. You got any plans?
@errantEmber [he got home about twenty minutes later, sighing slowly.] Hey, baby.

The urge to crawl back to bed is real, y'all.
It's 5:30 am and I just burned myself on my coffeemaker.
@errantEmber Early dinner at Zuma. I remember you talking about Japanese food the other day, so I made a reservation.
@errantEmber Well. I made it an early day. [he grinned, gunning the engine.]

@errantEmber TXT: just got home - I'll start cooking something for dinner.
@RazzleDazzly I mean, that's not the worst.
@RazzleDazzly I know that in that search I'm going to stay far away from images.
@RazzleDazzly I feel like I'll have to be very careful in my research or else I'm going to get a bunch of porn.
@RazzleDazzly But she's still with me, so that counts for something.
@RazzleDazzly Yknow, mighta been.
@RazzleDazzly Hey, I married -Emily-. I have some taste.

It's a fucking shit week and it's only Wednesday.

@NotADeadHoofer Don't listen to him, Steve. It's great.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: I'm really hoping so I'm so sick of the same fight TXT: neither of us wins
@RazzleDazzly TXT: I'll talk to her - I'm sure she's down
@RazzleDazzly TXT: so you still could ~
@RazzleDazzly TXT: I hope she does. We've fought about it enough. And she'll still be on the board and have controlling shares
@RazzleDazzly TXT: which I feel bad about because I may have caused some of it but she was miserable all the time
@RazzleDazzly TXT: she wants to spend more time with me and Si.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: Emily's gonna be stepping down as CEO so if you wanna part of the company now is the time to ask
@RazzleDazzly Listen, Emily was a big fan of some of the pieces. So.
@RazzleDazzly That was my favorite undercover mission.
@errantEmber TXT: I'll start dinner.
@errantEmber TXT: yeah, just took my boots off.
@errantEmber It's a pain. And it's hard to make other people see it.
@morningbrings [he grins, leaning in against her.]
@errantEmber need to deal with it. [he shrugged one shoulder, mussing Si's hair.]
@errantEmber They just don't get the idea of the team, yknow? Even if it didn't happen on your watch you still --
@errantEmber Oh, just dumb fu- freakin kids that are out for themselves.
@morningbrings Let's try a little bit of everything.
@errantEmber C'mon, you and I can get the big one. Okay? [he helped Si peel off the lid, giving him a high five.] Good job.
@morningbrings [he leans in to kiss her.] I don't mind staying up all night with you.
@errantEmber [he leaned in to kiss her cheek, smiling.] Work was okay?
@morningbrings We can find something else.
@morningbrings I'm okay with that.
@errantEmber [he smiled as he followed Em, placing Si on the counter.] All sorts of fun stuff.
@morningbrings Yeah. Start a wall of sticky notes.
@morningbrings We should start a list.
@errantEmber [he opens the door a few moments later, Si on his hip.] Hey, baby.
@morningbrings Hell yeah.
@errantEmber TXT:
@morningbrings Beer always makes everything better.
@errantEmber TXT: the latter sounds better.
@errantEmber TXT: I would kill for some Indian food.
@errantEmber TXT: dinner would be incredible. you wouldn't mind?
@errantEmber TXT: fucking terrible day at work I'll be in bed with Simon when you get home.
@morningbrings Dunno what I would do without them.
Got my legs all kinds of busted up. Fuck.
@errantEmber [he smiles, leaning in to kiss her cheek.] I'm happy for you.
@errantEmber [he hums, running his fingers through his hair.] Have you decided what you're going to do after you're no longer CEO?
@errantEmber [he smiles softly, leaning in to kiss her again.] I love you.
@errantEmber I know. And I had known you were working on something like this, I wouldn't have said anything. Or been so mean.
@errantEmber I love you too. I'm sorry I got so pissy earlier.
@errantEmber It was worth the wait. I'm really proud of you.
@errantEmber Hey, hey. [he rubbed a hand down her back, pulling her close.] It's okay.
@errantEmber [he nodded, leaning in to kiss her forehead.] Yeah. Only you could have pulled this off.
@errantEmber [Clint sat up, reaching to run his hand down her arm.] I'm really fucking proud of you. This is huge.
@errantEmber I can't believe you're serious. You really wanna do this?
@errantEmber [Clint blinked, partly unsure of what she was saying was real.] What? Holy fuck, Em. Are you serious?
@errantEmber Yeah? [he rubs his eyes, glancing over at her.] What's up?
@errantEmber [he woke from his doze, yawning as he shifted over.] Hey, baby.
@errantEmber [he nodded, leaning in to kiss her cheek before heading to bed.]
@errantEmber [he placed a hand on her waist, squeezing gently.] I'll see you in bed?
@errantEmber [he sighed as he stepped forward, taking her hand.] I love you, Em.
@errantEmber Is there a reason for us to keep talking?
@errantEmber [he shrugged.] It's fine. Like I said, probably won't get it. It's not worth fighting about.
@errantEmber older than most of them.
@errantEmber It might require me to be at work later at night. Pulling longer hours. So I dunno if it's for me. Besides, I'm a decade --
@errantEmber would put me in charge of squadron leaders. Taking a bigger role in developing the leadership program.
@errantEmber I didn't mention it because it's highly unlikely for me to get it. [he shook his head, running a hand through his hair.] It --
@errantEmber I'm going against are much, much younger. So I was home late, tonight. Won't happen again.
@errantEmber Emily, I'm going for a promotion. [he glanced back at her, folding his arms.] A promotion where most of the guys --
@errantEmber bed. We've fought this fight like six times, we're not going to say anything new.
@errantEmber You've been working on all of it for a while. [he stood, tossing his empty beer bottle into the recycling.] I'm going to --
@errantEmber [Clint resisted the urge to roll his eyes, leaning back in his chair.] Fine. Sure. Of course it is.
@morningbrings [he matches her grin.] All of those sound amazing.
@morningbrings [he grins, leaning in to kiss her.] True.
@errantEmber Temporary? Emily, it's been going on since you took over the company! It's impossible for you to say no to your father.
@errantEmber face, but whenever we fight you -always- bring up my deployment. I -get- it. I fucked up. I shouldn't have done it.
@errantEmber Emily. You know that was the -biggest- mistake of my life and I fucking regret it. You talk about me throwing stuff in your --
@errantEmber Oh? Why not? He needs you, Em. He's a child, still developing.
@errantEmber It has to deal with -Simon-, that's why I'm pissed. He should have one of us home.
@errantEmber I've been home late a handful of time. This isn't about me, Em.
@errantEmber Stay late is like eight o'clock. It's going on -midnight-, Em.
@errantEmber when it starts getting bad.
@errantEmber on stuff with me, that was fine. I could get over that. But when you bring Si into all this bullshit? That's --
@errantEmber You're -really- gonna have to start coming up with something better, Em. Because I didn't give a shit when you skipped out--
@errantEmber [Clint glances up, beer bottle in hand as he watches her.] Hey.
Goodnight, Si. Da loves you.
I know you haven't seen Momma but you gotta go to bed, little one.
You had dinner, right? Good.
@errantEmber TXT: good call.
@errantEmber TXT: emily charlotte what the fuck
Hey, Si, sorry. I thought Momma would be home.
Well Carol, I'm really sorry, here's something extra. I'll call you.
Where's Em?
Carol? What are you doing here?
@morningbrings It's the most important thing.
@morningbrings Mm, true, that is much more important.
@errantEmber [he grins.] Excellent. Beach?
@errantEmber Well, it's the forth, and I know you heathens don't celebrate it here, but I thought we could get away for the day.
@morningbrings If you're tired, that's okay.
@morningbrings [he presses a long kiss to her temple.]
@errantEmber Can you take any time off this week?
@morningbrings Really glad I met you, Sam.
@morningbrings [he hums and wraps his arm around her.]
Do you sometimes look at your coworkers and wonder how the fuck they got their job.
@morningbrings [he hummed, sinking a hand into her hair.]
@morningbrings [he laughed, kissing her shoulder.]
@errantEmber Emily, I'm sorry. I didn't want to worry you when there was no reason for it, I'm going to be okay.
@errantEmber some UNIT soldier who wouldn't have the right answers.
@errantEmber [he sighed, running a hand through his hair.] I wanted to tell you myself, I didn't want you to get a call from --
@errantEmber Yeah. Eventually. Went to medical because I thought it wasn't a big deal, and they turfed me to the hospital.
@errantEmber I know, I'm sorry. Maybe over text wasn't the best way to tell you.
@errantEmber It's okay. Really. I'm just in this for three to six weeks.
@errantEmber Oh, just a training accident. [he shrugged, rummaging for his water bottle.] Broke my elbow, busted my wrist.
@errantEmber [Clint tosses his bag in first before sitting, leaning over to kiss her cheek.] Hey, baby.
@errantEmber TXT: I'll be here.
@errantEmber TXT: alright. I'll see you soon.
@errantEmber TXT: me is taking me home.
@errantEmber TXT: gimmie ten minutes and I'll be home and we can talk about it
@errantEmber TXT: you know me I'm gonna be fine. Just some minor scrapes
@morningbrings It's pretty hot.
@morningbrings You sure know the way to a mans heart. [he flops on the couch next to her, kissing her cheek.]
@morningbrings [he smiles warmly at her before standing, heading to the kitchen.]
@errantEmber TXT: got a liiiiiiittle fucked up at work today https://t.co/emQmbWRJJd
@morningbrings I love that.
@errantEmber I know. I've missed you, too.
@morningbrings [he grins.] Works for me.
@morningbrings [he grins.] Works for me.
@errantEmber Hi. [he grins and wraps his arms around her waist.] What's that for?
@morningbrings I think we'll be good.
@errantEmber [he comes home a little while later, smiling softly.] Hey, baby.
@errantEmber TXT:  on my way home!
@morningbrings Perfect.
@morningbrings And beer?
@morningbrings Absolutely. What do you want for toppings?
@morningbrings You wanna pick up a movie or something?
@morningbrings Absolutely.
@errantEmber TXT: turns out Da can't and the wrist brace will be off in like a week
@errantEmber TXT: hey so uh Simon found a picture of someone walking on their hands in the circus and asked if Da could do that still
@morningbrings [he kisses he top of her head, sighing.]
@morningbrings Yaaaaay, so fun. [he smiles sadly and wraps his arm around her shoulders.]
@morningbrings Oh absolutely. Can't beat looking over your shoulder every damn second of the day.
@morningbrings // I love it!
@errantEmber Hi. [he smiles and glanced back at her.] Hey.
@morningbrings That's always fun.
@morningbrings // I got so confused at first haha!
Father's Day is weird. Like, I have a son, and that's great, he's incredible, but I get thinking about my dad.
@irishwhips Thank god. I'm glad.
@irishwhips Yeah, i understand that. He can't get to you, right?
@errantEmber TXT:
@irishwhips It drives me fucking crazy.
@irishwhips So fucking stupid.
@irishwhips Fucking exactly. You would think it would be obvious.
If my dad had a gun in the house with his temper, do you think I'd be alive? No.
No fucking -way- should they -ever- be allowed a gun.
But if that person has a history of domestic violence?
Okay, listen. I'm all for being armed - I'm always armed, and I wouldn't mind Emily being armed either.
@errantEmber TXT: want to be my hot lunch date?
Kid. It ain't worth it. Trust me.
...Simon has decided to grow up and join the circus. cc: @errantEmber
@RazzleDazzly Just throwing it out there~
@errantEmber TXT: I'm down with that.
@errantEmber TXT:  good. Si and I made dinner.
@errantEmber TXT: https://t.co/Mb0spnTK99
Friday is for binge watching The Walking Dead in my office.
@errantEmber Ah fuck. Yes. But I did the thing.
Oh fuck I have to remember to vote tomorrow.
@errantEmber ["I love you too, Mumma!" Clint grins and kisses Si's forehead.] We love you too, monster.
@IronPep Nah, I wouldn't say nemesis. More like. List of pissed of people.
@errantEmber [Clint grinned against her lips, placing a hand on her waist.]
@errantEmber Yes ma'am. I feel like my service was admirable.
@IronPep Aaah, well...
@errantEmber Man, sorry ma'am. [he flopped on the couch, staring up at her.] Yknow, there's also a delivery fee.
@IronPep Who's was it?
@IronPep Ooooh?
@IronPep Fuck yes.
@errantEmber kiss, please.
@errantEmber And, whoop! [he takes the juice box before taking Si off his shoulders, letting him drop on the bed.] Payment is one --
@errantEmber for a miss Barton-Moore?
@errantEmber [almost five minutes later Clint comes upstairs, Si happily on his shoulders, juice box in hand.] Uh, delivery --
@errantEmber Alright. I'll go get him. See you in five?
@errantEmber Sounds good to me. What flavor?
@errantEmber I'll gladly do that. Mind bringing my beer up?
@IronPep Even real you has that.
@errantEmber [he nods, kissing her cheek before handing her the glass.] I'll get the monster. Meet you on the couch?
@IronPep @errantEmber You kicking the shit out of Lego Tony? Yes.
@errantEmber My vote goes for Lego Batman.
@errantEmber Yeah. That sounds great. He has good taste.
@errantEmber [he wraps his arms around her waist, pulling her close.]
@errantEmber Yeah. That sounds really, -really- great. [he smiled at her.] Full glass of wine?
@errantEmber [he shrugged one shoulder.] I'm still exhausted.
@errantEmber [he pops open a bottle and pulls out a bottle of wine, popping the cork.]
@errantEmber Hey. I'm going to have a beer. You want a glass of wine?
Slept for almost eighteen hours.
@errantEmber [Si nodded, and Clint kept him in his arms as they went over to the fridge.] Wow, kid. These are really good.
@errantEmber Hey, bud. [Clint crouched down to pick him up, running his hands through his hair.] Have fun with Mum at the office?
@errantEmber [he rubbed his hand up and down her spine.] How's the little man?
@errantEmber [he wraps his arms around her waist and kisses her cheek.] Glad you're safe.
@errantEmber [he makes his way in a half-hour later, looking exhausted as he drops his pack.] Hey, Em.
@RazzleDazzly Happy 25th birthday for the fifth time? Or is it six.
@errantEmber TXT: starving. didn't have time to really eat today
@errantEmber TXT: that would be amazing I'm ready to pass out
@errantEmber TXT: they're finally making me go home. you at your office or w/ Si?
@errantEmber TXT: yeah, I'm not hurt. Probably not going to be out of here for a few hours.
@errantEmber TXT: are you still at your office?
@errantEmber TXT: will do, baby. Don't expect me home tonight
@errantEmber TXT: I will. Love you
@errantEmber TXT: I gotta go to work. stay at your office, okay?

Taking @errantEmber and Si on a hike tomorrow.
@errantEmber Hey. I got Monday off. Wanna go somewhere?
@NotADeadHoofer What is my life?
@KeepsTonyInLine I'm just exhausted.
Jesus Christ what is my life right now.
Poured hot water into the French press without any coffee beans.
@errantEmber [he sighed, leaning his head back.] I know. I promise I do. And I am mostly happy. It's just shit like this.
@errantEmber do. Those decisions have always been made for me. I don't know how to make then.
@errantEmber miraculously got into any kind of university, it would just be throwing money in the trash because I don't know what I want to-
@errantEmber Emily. This is the only thing I've known how to do for almost twenty years. I don't know how to do anything else. If I somehow-
@errantEmber Not really that many opportunities for a solider with a first grade education, Em. What would I do?
@errantEmber [he shrugged, twisting the glass and watching the ice cubes clink against the glass.] Nothing to be done.
@errantEmber [he tilts the glass back, sighing at the familiar taste.] Still thinkin' I could leave that shit in the desert.
@errantEmber I'm okay. [he rubbed his hands over his face.] Or. Well.
@errantEmber [he smiled quickly at her before sitting down at the table, running his hands over his face.]
@errantEmber Please. And, uh. Don't let me have more than three.
@errantEmber Yeah. Yeah, I need one. [he knew he shouldn't, knew it was a bad idea but couldn't help it.]
@errantEmber [he nodded, still half-distracted.] Yeah. Yeah, I know. [he sighed, slipping a hand under her shirt.] Drink?
@errantEmber really... [the thought died in his throat and he coughed.]
@errantEmber [he rubbed his hand down her spine, kissing the top of her head.] Yeah. It was awful. Just --
@errantEmber It was okay. I mean. [he shrugged.] Lotta dead kids.
@errantEmber [he hums as he wraps his arms around her, pulling her close.]
@errantEmber [he comes in about fifteen minutes later, smiling tiredly as he sees her.] Hey.
Si, let's just lay on the couch, yeah? Da needs to sleep.
Hi, Simon, handsome. I missed you too.
@errantEmber TXT: I'll see you soon
@errantEmber TXT: about to be. just finished up my debrief
@errantEmber TXT: you should come home early and have a drink with me
Finally on the plane home. I'm exhausted.
Just pissed off about everything.
Casually falling asleep waiting for this conference call.
Been working for almost twenty four hours.
@errantEmber TXT: gonna be here all day. I'll text you when I'm on a flight home
@errantEmber [he smiled before picking up Simon, kissing his cheek.] Be good for Mum.
@errantEmber I love you. [he kisses Em firmly.] I'll text you when I'm on my way home.
@errantEmber Hey, baby. Stuff is going down in Manchester. I have to go to work.
Nimbus are you okay. https://t.co/17biDGs6gA
@errantEmber [he nods, picking Si up and settling him on his lap.]
@errantEmber Mmmm. [he rolled his eyes.] So fun.
@errantEmber I have a work training. An overnight.
@errantEmber Hey, I've got to go to Wales June third and fourth. Are you good to be home with Si?
@errantEmber TXT: See you in ten.
@errantEmber TXT: miss you too. Need anything? Tylenol, food, etc?
@errantEmber TXT: Alright. I got nothing else for my day, I'll head home soon.
One day I'll be able to go to bed the same time as my wife.
Another late fucking night.
@errantEmber [he smiles and takes a sip of his own glass before beginning to pull out the things for tomato sauce.]
@errantEmber [he fills them to above the curve, handing her the glass.{
@errantEmber No worries. Mind getting me two glasses?
@errantEmber [he grins and he grabs the bottle he bought, searching for a corkscrew.
@errantEmber White or red?
@errantEmber [he smiles, flushing a bit.] Yeah, it's not bad. Want a glass of wine with it?
@errantEmber What do you want?
@errantEmber I can make dinner, if you want.
@errantEmber Do you want to go out tonight? Or stay in?
@errantEmber Happy Mother's Day, baby.
Quick Saturday shift. Si won't even realize I'm gone.
@errantEmber TXT: on my way home (a little late sorry) but I have stuff for dinner.
@errantEmber [Clint shrugged one shoulder.] It was fine. Yknow.
@errantEmber Excedrin, maybe? [he moved to wrap his arms around her, rubbing a thumb into her shoulder blade.]
@errantEmber You want some Tylenol, or anything? [he frowns, running a hand through her hair.]
@errantEmber I'm sorry, I really didn't plan to be this late.
@errantEmber [crawls in bed next to her, kissing her shoulder.] Hey.
@errantEmber TXT: I'll make it up to you. This weekend?
@errantEmber TXT: baby, I'm really sorry.
@errantEmber TXT: I'm not exactly sure when I'll be home
@errantEmber TXT: hey. baby. I'm really sorry, but I can't make it to dinner tonight. I got caught up in some work stuff.
@errantEmber [he changed into joggers quickly, before sliding into bed and sighing.]
@errantEmber [he nodded, reaching out to squeeze her hand.]
@errantEmber You don't have to apologize. I just want to make sure everything is okay.
@errantEmber Everything okay? You have been a little quiet recently.
@errantEmber Yeah. [he runs a hand through his hair, sighing.] Yeah. I'd like that.
You know what would be great right now? A shot of Jameson. Or like six.
@errantEmber I'm sure it will.
@errantEmber Yeah? That sounds amazing.
@errantEmber [he nods, rubbing a hand down her spine.] Okay.
@errantEmber Everything okay, baby? [he muttered it into her hair, holding her close.]
@errantEmber I think it would be really cool to expose him to something like that.
@errantEmber Well cool. I like traveling with you.
@errantEmber Oh yeah?
@errantEmber [smiles softly and kisses her.] Let's go for a week sometime.
@errantEmber [laughs softly.] Well, I'm glad for that, because we're gonna be stuck doing it for a while.
Rainy weekend in France, but I spent it in bed with @errantEmber. So not all bad.
@errantEmber [he grins, wrapping his arm around her middle.] You're welcome, baby.
@irishwhips Oh, fucking absolutely.
Happy birthday to the woman who puts up with all my shit and then some. Love you to the end, baby. cc: @errantEmber https://t.co/tZFROOqjBz
@ShieldbearerPep Everything is the worst.
@irishwhips I get that. Emotions are the worst.
@irishwhips You could kick anyone's ass. You're badass as hell and show everyone every day.
Sometimes I just want to drink my problems but then I remember I'm sober.
Over it.
Fuck today man.
@errantEmber My birthday present to you.
@errantEmber you like, just put it on my credit card.
@errantEmber [he smiles and turns in her arms, kissing her forehead.] Love you, baby. If you find tickets --
@errantEmber That sounds incredible. Want to look at tickets?
@errantEmber We can do a weekend in Wales.
@errantEmber Maybe we can get away this weekend?
@errantEmber We can just do something small. You and me and Si. Maybe your parents.
@errantEmber Do you want to?
@irishwhips You're not weak. In any sense of the word.
@errantEmber Thanks, baby. [kisses her cheek.] I can do dinner and then maybe something bigger on the weekend for your birthday?
@errantEmber Hey. I have to work an overnight Thursday into Friday - are you going to be home to put Si to bed? I can do dinner.
@errantEmber Either or. Both sound amazing.
@errantEmber Yes. I'm starving.
@irishwhips Maybe just a little.
Worked seven and a half hours on a Saturday. I want to collapse into bed.
@irishwhips I can stop, if you want.
@irishwhips Good. Ain't nothing wrong with that.
Fuckin' stress chain smoking.
Fuckin' stress chain smoking.
@errantEmber Hopefully it tastes as good, too. Want anything to drink?
@errantEmber [he smiled softly, kissing her temple and handing her the sandwich.]
@errantEmber Thats still fine. What you're doing is important.
@errantEmber They're already pretty great.!
@errantEmber [he swayed them for a moment, wrapping his arm around her waist as he turned off the stove.]
@errantEmber [he smiled, rubbing his thumb into her shoulder.] I love you. He does too.
@errantEmber It's okay. [he leaned in to kiss her cheek.] i missed six months of bedtime. He'll forgive you.
@errantEmber You okay? [he didn't want to push her, make her talk about something she didn't want to.]
@errantEmber Hi, baby. [he rubs a thumb into her hand, diving softly.] He's still out?
@errantEmber [he smiles back at her, yawning before heading into the kitchen.]
@errantEmber I'll toast your sandwich. [he sat up, stretching and yawning.]
@errantEmber We miss you too, Em. Speaking of which, you should go give Si a kiss.
@errantEmber Yeah? [he kissed her forehead.] I got you and Si. I dunno if it can get better.
@errantEmber Yeah? [he rubs his fingers into her lower spine.] Wanna talk about it?
@errantEmber You haven't been impossible. I know what you're doing at work is important.
@irishwhips It's the truth.
@errantEmber Hi. [he smiled sleepily, stroking his fingertips up and down her spine.]
@errantEmber [he blinks awake as she kisses him, smiling.] Hey, baby.
@errantEmber [he only half wakes up from his doze at her entrance, yawning.]
@irishwhips You're fucking beautiful.
@errantEmber [he makes the sandwich, waiting for her to get home to toast it. he flops in the couch instead, sighing.]
@errantEmber [he smiles, running a hand through his hair.] I'll see you soon, Em.
@errantEmber Nah, I'll be up. You want the sandwich toasted?
@errantEmber Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
@irishwhips [he smiles against her lips, beginning to sway them.]
@errantEmber What do you want in it?
@irishwhips Great. [he grinned before leaning in to kiss her.]
@errantEmber We got some leftover pasta. Or I could make a sandwich.
@irishwhips I'm glad I have your approval.
@errantEmber Do you want something way better than a salad?
@errantEmber Have you had dinner?
@errantEmber Hi. [he ran a hand over his face.] Sorry, for earlier. If you were busy. He was insisting.
@irishwhips Good. Because I want to do more of it.
@errantEmber [around half an hour later he calls her again, shutting Si's door quietly.]
@errantEmber I'll call you when he goes down. Love you, Em. [he kisses the top of his head before hanging up.]
@irishwhips [he pulls back to brush his nose against hers.]
@irishwhips [he wraps his around her, pulling her closer.]
@errantEmber [presses a kiss to his temple before pulling back a bit.] Alright. Tell Mama you love her to bits. ["Love you, Mama".]
@irishwhips [he hums happily, pulling her close.]
@errantEmber here when you wake up tomorrow, and extra stories.
@errantEmber [Simon still looks unhappy but nods, reaching for the phone. "Okay."] Alright. Give all your love to Mama, okay? She'll be--
@errantEmber talk to her and she'll give you extra stories tomorrow, okay?
@errantEmber [Simon frowns, shaking his head. "No."] C'mon, Si. Mama will stay on the phone a little so you can --
@errantEmber Sure. Hey, bud. [Clint pulls Simon into his lap, putting his phone on speaker.] Hey Mama.
@errantEmber [he answers, sounding a little tired.] Hey, baby.
@irishwhips [smiles and kisses her cheek.]
@errantEmber TXT: do you have a spare minute to call? That might help.
@errantEmber TXT: you gonna be home soon? Monster is refusing to go to bed until Mum says goodnight.
@irishwhips [grins.] We match in hotness.
Today is Take Your Kid To Work Day, so Si and I are spending the day in my office hanging out.
@irishwhips Absolutely.
@irishwhips That's hot.
also I'm happily married but I'll pretend to be a boyfriend to get a dude to back off.
Today my female coworker was catcalled in uniform. Dude, she can beat you up.
The fact that we're still fighting about science? You've got to me fucking kidding me.
@errantEmber [he grabs two glasses, placing one in front of her. he fills both glasses maybe a little too far before taking a sip.]
@irishwhips Yeah? I'm down for that. [grins wolfishly.]
@errantEmber Today blew. Want some wine?
Just plain awful.
The past two days have been so fucking stressful.
@errantEmber 's whatever at this point.
Better than the usual six I want, so. Progress.
Also known as all I wanted was like four glasses of wine and to get out of there.
Easter dinner with @errantEmber's parents was not the worst. But it also was not not the worst.
@irishwhips [he grins against her skin, rubbing a thumb into her hip.] Yes ma'am.
@irishwhips [he whistles as he watches her, a grin spreading across his face. he followed her, kissing a line up her shoulder.]
@errantEmber [he smiles and squeezes her hand and as they head to the car.]
@errantEmber Shhhh, no.
@errantEmber Shut up. He's not growing older. Ever.
@errantEmber I dunno, I'm pretty sure the trouble is all you.
@errantEmber He is. Of course, he's your kid.
@errantEmber [he shrugs on his jacket, kissing Si on the forehead.] Be good tonight, yeah?
@irishwhips [he grins and gently nudges her towards the bed.]
@errantEmber Yeah. Not fuckin around tonight.
@irishwhips God. You're so fucking beautiful.
@errantEmber Yeah. Got reservations and everything.
@irishwhips [he tosses his shirt, tugging at hers.]
@errantEmber Want to go out tonight?
@irishwhips [his hands go under her shirt, mapping his way down her body as he kisses her.]
@errantEmber What time are you out of work?
@errantEmber [sticks out his tongue at her.]
@irishwhips [he grins as he follows her, squeezing her hand.]
@errantEmber I mean, I am now. Six hours ago I wasn't.
@irishwhips Your bedroom. Right fucking now.
I was so tired getting ready this morning that I almost put @errantEmber's moisturizer on my toothbrush instead of toothpaste.
@errantEmber [he smiles, leaning in to kiss her.]
@errantEmber Right near your birthday, too.
@errantEmber I'm offended you even had to ask. Of -course- we're going.
@errantEmber TXT: getting out of work early. Outside dinner with me and Si?
@irishwhips [he inches his hand up her spine, humming softly.]
@irishwhips [he grins at the kisses, slipping his hand under her shirt.]
Alright, Si. Pinky promise you won't tell Momma that ice cream was for dinner?
@irishwhips [he hums, wrapping his arms around her, pulling her close.]
@irishwhips [he hums softly, twisting his hand in her shirt.]
@irishwhips [he slips an arm around her waist, pulling her close.]
@IronPep Absolutely awful.
@IronPep What the fuck is that.
I'm dying oh my god.
I made the mistake of saving that I would work out with some of the kids from work.
@irishwhips We can find out.
@irishwhips You thinkin' we should put your ideas into action?
@errantEmber It's okay. I know you've been stressed.
@irishwhips [he grins, placing a hand on her hip.] Yeah?
@errantEmber [he grins and winks at her.]
@errantEmber Aw, thanks. But you're the real catch.
@irishwhips You can never tell what the bruises are from.
@errantEmber [he leans in so Simon can reach as well.]
@irishwhips I mean, we would already be on the ground, might as well fuck.
@errantEmber [he shuffled one shoulder, smiling.] I've had the same haircut for the past ten years.
@irishwhips Naaah, you could kick my ass. You're up a couple of notches.
@irishwhips ...well.
@errantEmber [Simon laughs as he wraps his arms around Emily.] Oooh, he's got your wrapped around his little finger.
@irishwhips ...it's a word.
@irishwhips You're awesomer.
@errantEmber Hey. [he grins and kisses her cheek as Simon reaches for her.] Some troublemaker has been asking for you.
@irishwhips I am so down for either.
@irishwhips Great ideas, really.
@errantEmber TXT: sounds great. See you soon!
@errantEmber I can make myself free. Little man is still up.
@irishwhips Both sound great.
@errantEmber TXT: when works for you?
@irishwhips Yeah? What kind of fun ways are you suggesting?
@irishwhips Yeah, pretty okay. Not not the worst. [he grins.]
@errantEmber TXT: can you at least take a quick break for some coffee?
@errantEmber TXT: skip what you're doing~
@irishwhips [he grins, leaning in to kiss her.] Yeah? Good. Cos I'm twisted, too.
@errantEmber TXT: it's fine! Just wanted to see if you and the little man wanted to go out for dinner tonight.
@irishwhips I've seen worse. Thankfully I'm not that.
@errantEmber TXT: hey you.
Driving home with the windows down and Bruce Springsteen on the radio. Not bad for a Monday.
@irishwhips It's the worst habit I've got.
@irishwhips I mean. I understand. I always got a little hot headed.
@irishwhips Fuckin' bullshit. They didn't like what you had to say.
@irishwhips They can go fuck themselves.
@irishwhips Trusting that it's going to get better is the worst advice I've ever gotten.
@irishwhips Exactly, it all varies person to person.
@irishwhips I wonder where the fuck that's coming from and if they know what they're talking about.
@irishwhips Old shit's the worst.
@irishwhips You wanna talk about it? Or maybe have a beer instead?
...Emily and Simon put glitter in my boots. cc: @errantEmber
@errantEmber Hey, can we, uh, talk about what happened the other day?
Ended up working a double. I'm fucking exhausted.
My life is in control I swear.
Sometimes you just needed a cheese quesadilla at five in the morning.
@errantEmber [he slides his fingers in between hers, sighing.]
@errantEmber No, I know. I get it. And you didn't, just...fuck. I hate this.
@errantEmber happened Wednesday.
@errantEmber I know. And I don't want to slip, I fucking hate it when it happens. But, it was just today, and everything that --
@errantEmber gone out, he should have known he wouldn't want to stop.] It's fine. You're right, anyway.
@errantEmber [he ran his hands over his face, breathing out slowly. he didn't want to be angry at her - she was right, he shouldn't have--
@errantEmber maybe even three.
@errantEmber want to fucking deal with any of it where it's supposed to be -safe-. So I'm going to have a fucking beer or two or --
@errantEmber happened -here-, Em. Where you are and where -Simon- is, and I could barely handle it in that fucking wasteland, I don't --
@errantEmber I don't want fucking -anything- to do with any fucking reminders of that desert. And I did it for -six- hours today. It --
@errantEmber I know. I know you're sorry and I know you didn't mean anything, but -fuck- Em. I hated today. Fucking -hated- it.
@errantEmber [he stood, running his hand through his hair, trying to ignore the uneasiness in his gut.]
@errantEmber Emily, I sat in six hours a debriefs on what happened on Wednesday. I'm going to have a few fucking beers.
@errantEmber You don't have to. I didn't have a lot, I can still drive. Im not drunk. You don't have to worry.
@errantEmber [he rolled his eyes, sighing.] Me an' the guys. Just for a few after work. It was a long day, Em.
@errantEmber What's the project? [he glanced over the papers before looking up at her, noticing the frown.] What?
@errantEmber [he glances over it before sitting back, resting his feet on her desk.] Like what?
@errantEmber Still no luck finding an assistant?
@errantEmber Yeah, none of this looks like any fun. [he leans in across her desk to kiss her.]
@errantEmber Hey, babe. [he places the chicken salad on her desk, sitting.] How goes things?
Went out for a pint. Had three.
@errantEmber [he knocks on her office door an hour later.]
@errantEmber TXT: I can absolutely do that. See you soon.
@errantEmber TXT: requests?
@errantEmber TXT: do you want me to bring you dinner?
@errantEmber TXT: I can absolutely do that.  are you home yet?
@errantEmber TXT: that's fine - I totally spaced it was Mother's Day yesterday. I'm sorry
Just a pint. I gotta get home to Em.
Aaah...you know what. Sure. I'll grab a beer with y'all.
@errantEmber TXT: lunch?
Meetings and debriefs all day. I hate this.
@errantEmber Yeah. Sounds great.
@errantEmber [he leans in to kiss her softly.]
@errantEmber Its fine. But I do love you, and I am happy here with you and Simon.
@errantEmber It isn't all bullshit.
@errantEmber I'm still in my career. I'm not active duty anymore, that's the only difference. And nothing is bullshit, Em.
@errantEmber I haven't.
@errantEmber I'm not going to resent you in five years. Why would I?
@errantEmber But I don't want to focus on what could be better. I want to focus on what we have.
@errantEmber No, it isn't. But I never would have imagined to have a life this good.
But it's more than I ever could have imagined I could have.
It's not the ideal life. Not the life I would have picked.
@errantEmber Because you asked last night. And I know you worry about me not being happy.
@errantEmber It's okay. But I just want to make sure you know I'm happy.
@errantEmber Okay. Good. I just wanted to make sure you knew.
@errantEmber Hey. You know that I am happy, here, with you, right?
@RazzleDazzly Well fuck. Anywhere near London?
@RazzleDazzly It sounds like a place with a nice sandy beach. Which I could be down for.
@RazzleDazzly I didn't even realize you still weren't in New York. Where are you?
@RazzleDazzly I didn't even realize you still weren't in New York. Where are you?
@RazzleDazzly Well, other than that, how are things?
@RazzleDazzly I mean. You can - it sucks, but it's possible.
@RazzleDazzly They don't deserve to be a peer, then.
@RazzleDazzly It's the fuckin' worst. When people don't know you outside of the addiction.
@RazzleDazzly Whoever they are, fuck 'em. Not worth your time.
@errantEmber [he hums, leaning his head back as she nips down his jaw.]
@errantEmber 'm alright. Dunno where I would be without you.
@errantEmber -Yes-. [he leaned in to kiss her, looping a thumb in her belt loop.]
@errantEmber God, you're fucking -perfect-. [he grins, running his hands down her sides.]
@errantEmber [he sat back a bit, fingers working in the buttons of her shirt.]
@errantEmber Just because it's different doesn't mean I don't like it.
@errantEmber I would. But I'm happy here, with you and Si.
@errantEmber Of course I am.
@errantEmber I love you too, Em.
@errantEmber [he smiles against her lips, sinking both hands into her hair.]
@errantEmber [he hums softly, pulling her close.]
@errantEmber [he's only half paying attention as he finishes the glass, rubbing a thumb into her shoulder.]
@errantEmber [he smiled at the kiss, moving to wrap an arm around her shoulders.]
@errantEmber [he leans into her a little, closing his eyes for a moment.]
@errantEmber Yeah. I'm absolutely okay with that. [he takes a long sip of wine, standing.]
@errantEmber [he smiled, glancing over as he uncorked the bottle to pour himself another glass.] Yeah. It counts.
@errantEmber [he finished his glass, reaching to look at the label.]
@errantEmber putting a bit more in his glass.] It's pretty good wine.
@errantEmber [he knew that was the best idea. but he couldn't ignore the urge to pour another glass. he glanced over at her briefly before--
@errantEmber [he would much rather talk about Si than anything else. he finished his glass, leaning in to kiss her cheek.] Another glass?
@errantEmber I'm really glad we had him. Even though it was complicated and hard at first.
@errantEmber Fucking absolutely. [he glances over at her, rotating his glass.] What did you and Si get up to for the rest of the day?
@errantEmber [the silence stretched for almost too long and he took a long sip of his wine, unsure of what to say.]
@errantEmber shoulder, scratching his jaw.] Yeah. Fine.
@errantEmber [he didn't want to talk to her about this. he wanted to forget about his time overseas, the deployment. he shrugged one --
@errantEmber [he smiles, leaning in to her kiss and taking a long sip of his wine.]
@errantEmber I dunno, I thought I left that behind in the desert. [he shrugged one shoulder.]
@errantEmber Thanks. I didn't think something like that would happen here.
@errantEmber [he places a glass in front of her, rubbing a thumb over his wine glass.]
@errantEmber I'll get the glasses if you want to choose the wine.
@errantEmber [he nodded, kissing her cheek as he stands.]
@errantEmber What about wine or something? [he wanted to have a drink. more than anything else.]
@errantEmber [he smiled over at her, suddenly not hungry.] You want a beer?
@errantEmber [he shook his head, pushing the food around.] I was fine.
@errantEmber Hi. [he sits, leaning to kiss her temple.] How was the rest of your day?
@errantEmber [he smiled softly at her before leaving, coming back around ten minutes later in a flannel and joggers.]
@errantEmber That sounds great. I'll be right back - gonna give him a kiss and then change.
@errantEmber No, it's fine, little man needs his sleep. 'm just gonna give him a kiss goodnight.
@errantEmber [he smiled, wrapping his arms around her as she pulled him in close.] Me too, Em. Is Si asleep?
@errantEmber [Clint made it home about an hour later, looking exhausted when he made it in.] Hey. Traffic is nuts.
@errantEmber TXT: yeah. on my way.
Day's finally over. Thank god.
@errantEmber [he grins, holding him close as he listens.] Yeah? And you got to visit Momma. That's great.
I just want to fucking have a drink.
@errantEmber [Si giggles at the kiss, wrapping his arms around Clint's neck.] He's pretty talkative today.
@errantEmber [he comes back about fives minutes later, a very happy Simon in his arms.]
@errantEmber You're so sweet. I'll be right back.
@errantEmber I'm gonna go get him. [he smiled, standing and leaning in to kiss her.]
@errantEmber Yeah, it really is. He doesn't need to know about any of it.
@errantEmber Great. Cool.
@errantEmber What did Carol tell him about leaving so abruptly?
@errantEmber I'll get Si and Carol.
@errantEmber Yeah. I mean, the news isn't good. But it's not getting worse.
@errantEmber No, just checking to make sure things are going smoothly.
@errantEmber [he chose something off the menu, stepping back to check his phone after.]
@errantEmber Oh man. Maybe Chinese?
@errantEmber Yeah. That'd be great. It's probably going to be a late night for me.
@errantEmber I know. I really do want to stay. But I'm glad you and Si and Carol are safe.
@errantEmber No, I have to go back in. They still don't know who's behind it.
@errantEmber I was worried about you. [he runs a hand through her hair.] They still don't know a lot.
@errantEmber I will in a minute. [he rubbed a thumb into her side, smiling softly.]
@errantEmber [he wraps his arms around her waist.] Hey, baby.
@errantEmber [he knocks on her office door about an hour and a half later.]
@errantEmber TXT: good. I'm gonna swing by once this is all over.
@errantEmber TXT: xxxx stay clear of Westminster bridge
@errantEmber TXT: yes ma'am.
@errantEmber TXT: I gotta go. unit is heading out to the scene. love you.
@errantEmber TXT: be careful. text me when they leave and as soon as he gets there.
@errantEmber TXT: Hey, stay safe in London - things are going down. Can you check in on Si?
Got some spy movies and a beer. Things are great.
Kid's finally crashed from his sugar high.
@errantEmber Great. [grins.]
@errantEmber Is it the sexy kind of punished?
@errantEmber I'm sorry. [leans in to kiss her softly.]
@errantEmber I love you.
Pretty sure @errantEmber has sent this to me. https://t.co/p9Ae0ivOG4
@errantEmber I wouldn't leave you.
@errantEmber Nah, not really. Haven't been in a place long enough to form something like this.
@errantEmber It's nice, to have someone around for this long.
I remember when Em and I was supposed to be just a hookup.
@errantEmber Like we've been together forever.
Little man is three today. Seems like @errantEmber and I got together just last year, and she told me she was pregnant yesterday.
Late lunch with @errantEmber and the little monster.
Spilt coffee all over myself. Yeah, it's Monday:
@errantEmber [he hummed, running a hand through her hair.]
@errantEmber Ugh, I mean, I -guess-.
@errantEmber No, I meant like, in the relationship. I'll like credit for being gross first.
@errantEmber You're the one that was disgusting first.
@errantEmber [he smiled as he closed his eyes.] Dunno what I would do without you.
@errantEmber [he hums softly, closing his eyes.] I love you, Em.
@errantEmber Yeah. It's been a ride. And I love doing it with you.
@errantEmber Cool. Me too. [he smiles, continuing to play with her hair.] ...he's gonna be three, Em.
@errantEmber Want to have lunch with me and Si?
@errantEmber Any way that you can work from home?
@errantEmber You okay? [he murmured, running a thumb into her scalp.]
@errantEmber Hi. [he wraps an arm around her shoulders, playing with the ends of her hair.]
God. Today sucked.
@errantEmber Let's stay in. I don't really want to be around people tomorrow.
@errantEmber I love you too. What do yo want to do tomorrow?
@errantEmber [kisses her firmly.] Hi. What's that for?
@errantEmber No. I'm glad we found out what was going on and fixed it.
@errantEmber Oh, absolutely better than before I left. We were fighting all the time.
@errantEmber [he sighs softly, closing his eyes.]
@errantEmber Yeah. It really was.
@errantEmber [he nods, running a hand through his hair.] We just fought about it so much last year.
@errantEmber It's not because I don't love him, or anything, I just forgot.
@errantEmber So I...might have forgotten. A little.
@errantEmber C'mon, baby. It's Si. I wouldn't forget.
@errantEmber [he smiled, leaning in to kiss her cheek.]
@errantEmber I did. I have it off.
@errantEmber I didn't forget. Just want to spend more time with my son.
@errantEmber ...looks like I'm taking two days off next week.
@errantEmber He would like both of us to stay home next Thursday.
@errantEmber We have a request from our son.
But no more hiding Da's keys.
Okay, listen. How about you choose a day that I stay home, okay?
Hey, Si, bud, let's not play hide Da's keys.
That awful moment when you're almost out of coffee beans so you're forced to make weak coffee.
@errantEmber Fiiiine. [he takes it, tossing the food in the bin.]
@errantEmber It is literally impossible to do that.
I mean, she cleans in a bralette and joggers. So it's fucking great.
After a passionate night of love making, @errantEmber and I are doing the sexy act of cleaning our fridge.
@Avengerstark Hey, no problem. I love driving this thing.
@Arachidman [fingerguns.]
@errantEmber TXT: see you soon
Man, I fucking love the Eagles.
@errantEmber TXT: just got out. Want me to pick anything up?
@errantEmber TXT: I sure don't
@errantEmber TXT:
@Avengerstark Oh absolutely.
@Avengerstark I mean, there's a good diner not too far from here.
@Avengerstark What are you in the mood for?
@Avengerstark [Clint or lend the door to the Charger, grinning.] This one.
@Avengerstark That's incredible. [he grinned, squeezing his shoulder.] I'm happy for you.
@Avengerstark No, holy shit man. That's incredible.
@Avengerstark Well, when it gets in the way of my wife and kid.
@Avengerstark Well. [he shrugged one shoulder.] I was beginning to not be able to function without a drink. My day revolved around it.
@Avengerstark Shes a beautiful car, it'll be worth it.
@Arachidman It took me a really long time to realize I had a problem.
@Avengerstark We can take mine.
@Arachidman I'm trying to. Takes a while.
@Arachidman I don't need it. Just, those cravings never go away.
@Avengerstark That sounds great, man.
@Arachidman It's why i stopped drinkin'.
@Avengerstark Brain injury? What happened?
@Avengerstark I miss spending time with you too, Tony. But if you don't mind...I gotta skip the drinking.
@Avengerstark Yeah. Absolutely.
@Avengerstark I really can't. I'm sorry, man.
@Avengerstark Aaah, fuck. I...can't, Tony. I can't just have one. I'll end up drinking that entire six pack.
@Avengerstark God. Honestly.
Just one of those days I want like, six beers.
@WadeWilson1974 Oh god.
Wow, everyone is awful today.
@errantEmber I don't look that hot.
Got glasses the other day. I just look old as shit. @errantEmber is trying to make me feel better. https://t.co/4pQRxecSCy
@irishwhips Fuck, Sam. I'm sure as hell not gonna say no.
@irishwhips God, and I have no doubt that I'm going to go crazy.
@errantEmber God. Right? Disgusting. Shouldn't be allowed.
@errantEmber I'm really fucking banking on that. [he grinned, wrapping his arms around his waist as he swayed them.]
@errantEmber God, I'm surprised I haven't been fired from UNIT yet. [he smirked, pulling his boxers back up.]
@errantEmber What are they gonna do, fire you? [he smirked.]
@errantEmber lunch ever.
@errantEmber [he grinned into her collarbone, breathless. after a minute he tilted his head back, catching her lips in a kiss.] Best --
@errantEmber hers, heat flooding his spine.]
@errantEmber [she clenches around him and it feels incredible. he keeps the pressure of his thumb as his hips stutter into --
@errantEmber [he changed the direction of his thumb, groaning as she tightened around him.{
@irishwhips [he laughed.] Well, -maybe- then.
@irishwhips Jesus. [he laughs a breathless laugh.] I ain't gonna stop you.
@errantEmber [he drags his teeth down her neck, the knot in his spine tightening as he thrusted into her.]
@irishwhips Fucking get up here. I want to be in you.
@irishwhips Jesus. [his eyes slip shut, grabbing at the couch with white knuckles.]
@errantEmber [satisfied, he ups the pace of his thumb, almost rough as he bucks his hips into her.]
@irishwhips [his hips shift at her kisses, unable to stop them.] I'm gonna try my best.
@irishwhips [a grin spread across his face, eyes roving over her face.] Great. I can't fucking wait.
@irishwhips You are gonna kill me, you know that? [he grins, breath a little fast.]
@errantEmber [he starts the motions, slowly as he leans in to bite a mark into his neck.] Louder, baby.
@irishwhips [his head tilts back at that, trying to keep his cool and totally failing.]
@irishwhips [a groan slips out of her mouth at his actions, hips shifting without meaning to.]
@irishwhips -God-, Sam. [his breath catches in his throat, trying and failing to keep his cool.]
@errantEmber [he groaned as he sunk his teeth into her shoulder and adjusting his stance.] Best fucking time.
@irishwhips You are really fucking good at it. [he laughs, kicking off his pants.] Like the best.
@irishwhips Well you do a good job of driving me crazy enough to get bossy. [he kisses her as he works at his belt.]
@errantEmber [he grins against her mouth, rolling his hips and pressing his thumb.] Scream it.
@irishwhips [he rolls his eyes fondly, pulling at her belt loops.] Take your pants off before I rip them.
@irishwhips Okay, I mean, I could be wrong.
@errantEmber Yeah? What if I do? [he stops the motion of his thumb, barely slowing his thrusts.]
@irishwhips I mean that basically makes this not worth it. [he can't help but grin, working at the button on her pants.]
@irishwhips [he smiles at the the kiss, hands roving to the front of her pants.]
@irishwhips [he smiles at the the kiss, hands roving to the front of her pants.]
@errantEmber I fucking love you. [he increases the pressure of his thumb, breathless against her neck.]
@irishwhips [he's totally not blushing, nope. he leans in to kiss her, grinning.]
@errantEmber [he groans as she tightens, hips picking up pace.]
@irishwhips -Great-. I'm glad they will. [he grins, looking up at her.]
@errantEmber [he groans as she sinks her teeth into him, moving his hand to rub a thumb over her clit.]
@errantEmber [he drags her fingers down her back, keeping up with his pace.]
@errantEmber God, I fucking love you. [he murmurs it against her skin, slowly rocking into her.]
@irishwhips Oh man, well, me neither. [he concentrated on sucking a hickey into her neck.]
@errantEmber [he pushes into her, groaning softly as she pushes against him.]
@irishwhips Oh, no, of course. [he kisses a line down her skin.]
@irishwhips Yeah, with noooooooo ulterior motives I'm sure. [he rubs his thumbs into her hips, grinning.]
@errantEmber Yeah? [he grins and leans in, sucking a bruise under her shirt.]
@errantEmber [he moves to push up her skirt, beginning to lift her up.]
@errantEmber Get up back against that wall. [he's breathless, eyes blown as he takes a step towards her.]
@irishwhips You are always one step ahead of me. [he grins, leaning in to kiss a line down her chest.]
@irishwhips Hey. [he grins, pushing up her shirt.]
@errantEmber [he twists his fingers in her hair, shifting his hips as he rocks into her.]
@irishwhips [he strips his shirt up, falling back on the couch and taking him with her.]
@errantEmber [he shuts his eyes as she moves, hissing out a swear.]
@errantEmber Fucking Christ, Em. [he slides a hand through her hair, groaning.]
@irishwhips [he grins as he follows her, stopping as they're in front of the couch to kiss her.]
@errantEmber [he leaned in to kiss her, hips shifting in her hold.]
@irishwhips I'm down for some couch sex.
@errantEmber I'm surprised we even made it that far. [he grins as he hooks his thumb into her underwear.]
@errantEmber [he grinned at her breathing, pulling his pants and boxers down, running a hand up her thigh.]
@irishwhips Anywhere I can have sex with you is a good place.
@errantEmber [he presses her back against the wall, pushing the shirt up around her bra as he pops the button on her skirt.]
@errantEmber [he slips his hands under her shirt, pulling it out of her skirt.]
@errantEmber Yeah? [he grins wolfishly.] I was thinking about you, too
@irishwhips That sounds fucking perfect.
@errantEmber Hey, baby. [he grins and goes over to kiss her.] Si's out with the nanny.
@irishwhips Are you saying there should be a marathon in our future?
@errantEmber TXT: same. See you soon
@irishwhips Let's go to bed.
@irishwhips [he grinned, slipping a hand under her shirt.]
@errantEmber TXT: OKAY
@irishwhips [he wraps his arms around her waist, pulling her close.]
@errantEmber TXT:  lunch today?
@errantEmber TXT: fuck no, more like it. I'm not putting us through that again.
@irishwhips [he grins, leaning in to kiss her.]
@irishwhips You're pretty incredible in bed. Just saying.
@irishwhips Good is an understatement.
@errantEmber TXT: UNIT tried to get me to sign up for a second deployment
Listen, my marriage barely survived my first deployment. I'm not doing a second.
Ha, let me tell you in all the ways absolutely fucking not.
Y'all want me to go on a second deployment?
@irishwhips Anything sexy with you is a prize.
@irishwhips GREAT.
Now I'm running laaaaaaaaate as fuck.
This morning a groggily set a timer for what I thought was ten minutes. It was ten hours.
@irishwhips Are they sexy prizes?
@irishwhips Thanks, baby.
@errantEmber TXT:
@errantEmber TXT: Hawkeye to the rescue! With his adorable sidekick.
@irishwhips [he smiles, leaning into her hand.] I try.
@errantEmber TXT: when are you escaping today?
@irishwhips Well, you absolutely can, and always will. [he smirked and kissed her.]
Dropping keys is so exciting for a two year old.
@irishwhips They never would.
@irishwhips -Much- better than avocados.
Have to go get my license renewed. Cutting work early and picking up Si.
@irishwhips Hey, come on.
@irishwhips Yeah, but i like you, so obviously my taste isn't that bad.
@irishwhips I didn't realize you didn't like happiness.
@irishwhips Whaaaaat?
I may be a basic bitch but I fucking love avocado toast.
@WelcomeToLevel7 Want to get dinner and talk about it?
@WelcomeToLevel7 What? Why?
@WelcomeToLevel7 How has everything been?
@WelcomeToLevel7 Oof. Yeah, you know how it is.
@WelcomeToLevel7 [laughs softly.] It was only a graze.
@WelcomeToLevel7 I mean, I did get shot once. Minor.
@WadeWilson1974 @LIFECOACHERS That's the best excuse to not relax.
@WelcomeToLevel7 We're good. Better, much better. Told you I would make it out of the Middle East alive.
@WelcomeToLevel7 Welcome back, Phil.
@WadeWilson1974 Oh man. I am so confused.
Finally a warm day. Blasting country with the windows down.
Dear Mustang that was reviving their engine at the light we were at, hope you enjoyed eating my fucking dust.
Ohhhhh my god I want to go to bed.
Like honestly I've been out of the house for twelve hours I want nothing more than bed.
Hooooooly shit I'm ready to be home.
Actually no I wouldn't do that to my car.
Sometimes I love London. And then there's gridlock and I want to drive my car into the Thames.
@errantEmber [he rolls his eyes, leaning in to kiss her.]
@errantEmber It was sappy as shit.
I got drunk one night on vacation when the bar had karaoke and you know I dedicated a Springsteen song to https://t.co/JH7OK1bAQf
@MrNickCharles @IronPep See, you feel me.
@MrNickCharles @IronPep I mean CAN YOU BLAME ME.
One last hotel breakfast before hitting the road home.
No but really.Fuck Jersey. https://t.co/mjkGwMQqyW
@errantEmber [he grins against her lips, pulling her close.] Fuck yes. Let's go to bed right fucking now.
@errantEmber Would it be too cheesy to say that you're my Valentine's Day present?
@errantEmber Oh man that sounds awful. [he smirks, kissing her cheek.]
@errantEmber Oh yeah? Find anything good?
@IronPep Fucking -absolutely-.
@errantEmber I think what you said about the vacation home is the best idea.
@errantEmber We could honestly move out here.
@IronPep [he laughs softly.] Cmon. Let's have sex.
@IronPep You are totally overdue.
@errantEmber [he wraps his arms around her, wrapping his fingers in her shirt.]
@IronPep Yes. It's the best kind of sex.
@errantEmber But honestly. [he kisses her.] I love you. And you've done so much for me.
I don't know what I would do without Emily.
@errantEmber Sure thing, baby.
@errantEmber God, I fucking love you.
Spending Valentine's Day with @errantEmber and the Scottish highlands.
Stopping for the night.
@errantEmber [he leans in to bite at her neck as he carries her to the car.]
@errantEmber -Yes-. [he swoops her up, grinning.]
@errantEmber Oh, baby. You know that's never going to happen.
@errantEmber I love you too. To the moon and back.
@errantEmber [he smiled, rubbing a thumb into her hip.] Thanks, Em.
@errantEmber Yeah. It's a pretty crazy pipe dream. [he kisses her shoulder.] Forget it.
@errantEmber It would be nice to be close to Tony and Steve.
@errantEmber ...what if we got a place in New York?
@errantEmber Yeah? Up here?
@errantEmber I...don't know. I like the city, but it's nice to get back to the country.
@errantEmber It really does. [he sighs, resting his chin on her shoulder.]
@errantEmber Perfect. [he grins, kissing her cheek.]
@errantEmber We can live off the land. And the city isn't terribly far if we need something.
@errantEmber Let's stay forever. I can go home and pick up Si and we can live up here.
Hoooooly shit. It's incredible here. https://t.co/JAUVjoNTQQ
Back on the road again.
God, I love being on vacation.
@errantEmber [he groans at her bite, slipping his hands under her shirt.] Okay, no more talking.
@errantEmber Good. I do got some brain rattlin' around up there. [he grins up at her.]
@errantEmber Do you mean to say you're only in it for my looks? [he smirked, biting a bruise into her collarbone.]
@errantEmber I'm always down to mess around with you.
@errantEmber Absolutely messing around. [he grins and kisses her, rolling on top of her.]
@errantEmber Oh yeah. This bed is amazing.
@errantEmber Hi. [he rubs his eyes, sighing.]
@errantEmber [he hums, wrapping his arm around her shoulders.] Hey.
@errantEmber I do. I have an incredible wife, a great career and an amazing son.
@errantEmber I am happy. Just a couple of years ago I never would have dreamed that I would have a life like this.
@IronPep We should watch Rocky Horror.
@errantEmber Hey. [he takes her hand, kissing her fingers.] It's okay. Si is more than I ever could have dreamed for.
@errantEmber I mean, I wouldn't mind having more kids. But if it's not in the cards, it's not in the cards.
@errantEmber No, I...I know.
@IronPep Yes, mister Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey.
@errantEmber But you're fucking incredible. Amazing at your job, great with Si.
@errantEmber You work waaaaay too hard. [he squeezes her hand before leaning in to kiss her cheek.]
@errantEmber It's a good thing that you're getting away for a while.
@errantEmber I don't think it will. We did a lot to fix it. Us.
@IronPep The more the merrier, right?
@errantEmber [he stayed quiet for a moment, running his thumb into her hand.] Do you think it'll get that bad again?
@IronPep Absolutely. Do you want me to bring alcohol?
@IronPep Hey, sweetheart. What's up?
@errantEmber But if you enjoy it, I don't want you to give up.
@errantEmber But I don't want you to give up your dream. Your company.
@errantEmber I think...it's helped. A lot.
@errantEmber Of course, Em. [he reached over, entwining his fingers with hers.] What is it?
@errantEmber Yeah. Much better. I feel better. More...centered.
@errantEmber [he rolled his eyes, turning on the radio as they sped onto the highway.]
@errantEmber Not at all, Mrs. Barton.
@errantEmber [he flushed, rolling his eyes as  he started the car.] You're cute.
@errantEmber Same. And don't worry, the playlist I created has very little country.
@errantEmber [he smirked, kissing her before throwing his bag into the car.] Well, this baby need to stretch her legs.
@errantEmber Yeah. [he slung his bag over his shoulder.] Let's go.
@errantEmber [he sits next to her, rubbing his thumb into her hand as he thinks it over, trying to figure out where to start.]
@errantEmber [he smiled, placing a hand over hers.] I love you, Em.
@errantEmber [he leans against the counter, glancing to where the whiskey used to sit before glancing back at her.]
@errantEmber [he nods, taking his hand as he follows her.]
@errantEmber Yeah. That sounds great.
@errantEmber [he places his hand on her waist as he kisses her back.]
@errantEmber Um. Yeah. I think I do.
@errantEmber Yeah. I just had a thing earlier. Been thinking about Iraq.
But she always is there, to remind me of that.
Sometimes I wake up and I forget that I'm home and Emily's there.
@errantEmber Yeah. Take the Charger, drive around Scotland.
@errantEmber I'm thinking we could take a road trip.
@errantEmber Hey, think you can get away Monday through Wednesday?
Si also enjoys going fast in the Charger, but we're not gonna tell Mum about that.
I fucking -love- this car.
@errantEmber It's pretty incredible.
@errantEmber I love you so much.
@errantEmber I know. It's gross.
@errantEmber [he smiled, leaning in to kiss her.] Thanks, baby.
@errantEmber I definitely think I would still be drinking.
@errantEmber [he nodded, rubbing a thumb into her hip.]Leaving was awful. But sometimes I wonder where our marriage would be if I didn't go.
@errantEmber I know. I was worried when I left. But I was stupid to.
@errantEmber Deploying was the stupidest thing I've ever done. But I'm glad I had you to come home to.
@errantEmber Thanks, baby. [he drags his fingers down her spine.] I love being home.
@errantEmber [a grin spreads across his face as he slides his hands under her shirt, pulling her close.]
@errantEmber Hey. [he smiles and kisses her cheek.]
You know it's going yo be a day when you have to give yourself a pep-talk to drink your coffee.
@IronPep I mean, it -certainly- doesn't hurt.
@IronPep I'd rather be here. I honestly would much rather be here than anywhere else
@IronPep It does. It really does. I'm glad I made it home, too.
But today I worked from home and danced to The Who with my son.
I was convinced that I had failed in my marriage and made the worst snap decision.
Man, a year ago I was deploying to the middle of nowhere.
@errantEmber What are you in the mood for?
@errantEmber Hey. Want to go out for dinner later?
Si loves it when I work from home.
Made celebration homefries this morning.
Made celebration homefries this morning.
And that's what I love about her.
I know she doesn't care about football. Or muscle cars. But she does it because she knows I miss home.
@errantEmber [he grins, sitting back to take his own shirt off as he kisses her.]
@errantEmber I love you too, you're the best.
@errantEmber [he laughed, tugging at her shirt to pull it off.]
@errantEmber [he laughs, pulling at her shirt.] Great. Okay.
@ShieIdsDirector Oh DAMN.
Tom Brady is the best fucking quarterback of all time fucking fight me.
@errantEmber [he smiles, squeezing her hip.] Now I have to be up in three hours.
@errantEmber In fucking -overtime-, baby. Last minute and it was fucking -incredible-.
[he crawls into bed next to @errantEmber, grinning and kissing her shoulder.]
Okay, it's almost four in the morning. I have to sleep. Or more accurately, nap.
Best fucking thing of 2017!
OH MY GOD.
This is beautiful.
Overtime, holy shit.
God I'm fucking shaking.
TOUCHDOWN.
That's a goddam catch fuck you.
@irishwhips You're pretty incredible though.
It's a fucking MIRACLE.
HOLY SHIT.
@irishwhips Nah, come on. You're beautiful.
Hey @errantEmber I'm really sorry if I wake Si up.
God DAMN. That only took forever.
@irishwhips Always.
@irishwhips Holy shit you're fucking amazing.
@irishwhips Fuuuuuuck.
Alright. Get your shit together.
Finally halftime. Get it together.
God damn. Finally.
Just fucking throw the football in the trash instead.
This can't be fucking real.
Where the Patriots suck?
Am I in an alternate universe?
Are you fucking kidding me.
Oh man, looks like I'll be taking a sick day tomorrow.
Fucking Super Bowl Sunday. Si even has a Pats jersey on.
@errantEmber She's beautiful. [he shifts into drive, grinning a wild grin at her before peeling out of the parking lot.]
@errantEmber rumbling in response.]
@errantEmber [he laughs softly, gripping the steering wheel.] Alright. Sure. [he presses down on the acceleration, the engine --
@errantEmber I'm not sure if I should get a speeding ticket just yet.
@errantEmber We can joyride together. [he smirked at her, shifting into gear.]
@errantEmber I really do. I can't believe you thought of this.
@errantEmber She's beautiful. I love her, Em. She's perfect.
@errantEmber [he pressed the engine start button, a grin spreading across his face as the engine rumbled to life.] Oh, -baby-.
@errantEmber [he grinned, shaking his head.] No. It's perfect. I love it.
@errantEmber [he laughed at the purple on the gearshift and the steering wheel.] Em. This is amazing.
@errantEmber Only if I've got my copilot with me. [he took her hand, squeezing it.] Let's go get some speeding tickets.
@errantEmber Emily, god, I don't know what to say. -Thank- you. This is amazing. And so fucking sweet of you.
My British wife got me four thousand pounds of American muscle.
@errantEmber I fucking -love- it. [he turned, wrapping his arms around her.] Holy shit, Em.
@errantEmber [a grin split his face, eyes widening.] No fucking way, Emily. Holy...you bought me a fucking Dodge Charger?
@errantEmber Keys? [he blinked, turning them over in his hand.] What is it for?
@errantEmber [he makes his way down, giving her a kiss on the cheek.] What can I help with?
@errantEmber TXT: Be right down.
@errantEmber I love you too, Em.
@errantEmber [he smiles at her kiss, leaning in.]
@errantEmber Ha, thanks. We'll see.
@errantEmber Thanks. Maybe with someone else it won't be awful.
@errantEmber Rest In Peace, rolling garbage heap.
@errantEmber Want to go car shopping with me next week?
Fuck me.
So my car is no longer rolling.
I say rolling. Barely rolling.
My car is a rolling money pit.
@errantEmber I know. I can barely believe there isn't any meat.
Vegetarian burritos with @errantEmber. I think I'm going to die happy.
@IronPep What? That's crazy. No way.
@IronPep Trust me, I'm terrified. This is my terrified face.
@IronPep [he laughs, holding her tighter.] I know. Big bad Pepzilla.
@IronPep Of course, Pep. [he smiles and kisses her cheek.]
@IronPep Absolute deal. C'mere. [he motions her closer, wrapping his arms around her.]
@ShieldbearerPep Hello. Glad to follow!
@IronPep @ShieldbearerPep I just did.
@IronPep I can only imagine.
@IronPep Man, that's a long time.
@IronPep Oh man, right? I'm okay. Part of me wonders when I'm going to wake up.
@IronPep I have a lot of worry to spread around.
@IronPep No. And I'm really worried for you, Pep.
But it still makes me nervous.
I mean, I'm an American citizen and white. So we'll be fine.
@errantEmber Yeah. I mean, I know you, me, and Si will be fine. But I'm worried about the violence in airports and everything else.
Oh man, I want to watch London Has Fallen, but I can't.
@errantEmber You know how I said it would be fun to go to the US? Yeah, I'm thinking it's not a good idea to travel there.
What the fuck, America.
@errantEmber It's incredible because you're incredible.
True love is watching your wife prep the coffee for tomorrow morning. @errantEmber is the best, y'all.
I mean, I worked on a team with a guy who got famous for punching Hitler.
Man. Fried potatoes.
I hate moving. Period.
God I had to move offices today and it was the worst.
He's not an American citizen, but it's important that he knows.
Took Si to the women's march for a little bit today.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: any help would be appreciated
@RazzleDazzly TXT: I've stared working on Emily - I'll keep you updated.
@errantEmber That's what I thought. Maybe head out to Iowa.
@errantEmber We'll stay away from D.C. But give Tony and Steve a little pick me up. Show Si New York before it all goes to shit.
@errantEmber Hey. Want to take a vacation to the US for a little bit?
I'm trying to not be nervous. For Si. But we'll see.
Fleetwood Mac and swinging Si around the apartment.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: Yeah, show Si New York one last time and maybe head out west. Just so he knows what it's like.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: lovin that UK citizenship right now. May try to get over there sooner rather than later.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: good luck today bud
It is very hard not to drink today.
Today is our last day in Italy. Even though it was nice to get away, I miss Si.
@errantEmber [he smiled softly, leaning in to kiss her.] You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.
@errantEmber I know. I know you wouldn't. I just...I got hot-headed. Leaving you for a deployment was the stupidest thing I've ever done.
@IronPep I remember hearing of Enron. And how that sank.
@IronPep I'll do that. What does Stark Industries stock go for?
@IronPep How about I give you my money? Can I do that?
@IronPep I...have no idea what that means.
@errantEmber [he rubs his eyes, tightening his arm around her.] Still shitty.
@IronPep Is it too early to start buying gold? Is that a thing?
@errantEmber I thought you cheated on me.
@errantEmber I just...when I slip, I slip bad. I snap at you.
@errantEmber And...I'm trying. To get sober. So I can be better for you and Si. Because I've been shit.
@errantEmber I know. I do the same. I'll always come back to you.
@errantEmber I fucking love you too. You know that, right? Even after everything I've done?
@IronPep Yeah, I've been beginning to do that too. It's a pain.
@IronPep God. Smoking like a chimney and trying not to worry.
@IronPep God. This is the worst time to try to get sober.
@errantEmber Fuck yes. That sounds amazing.
@errantEmber [he hums at the kiss, winding his arms around her.]
@errantEmber Then let's stay. [he smiles, leaning in to kiss her.]
@errantEmber Really? You want to?
Tomorrow @errantEmber and I head home from Italy. It was so nice to get away.
My goal today is to eat shit less than three times.
@IronPep Awh, thanks, Pep.
@IronPep I'm funny, at least.
I wonder who's the smarter of the two. cc: @IronPep https://t.co/gnCrwxy7n0
If you think everyone in the Avengers are super smooth, I just tripped and ate shit trying to take my pants off.
@errantEmber Good think we can wait until Tuesday.
@errantEmber I loved doing this with you.
@errantEmber [he comes up behind her, wrapping his arms around his waist.] I love you.
@errantEmber You're a -goddess-.
@errantEmber [he kisses her cheek, closing his eyes.] I love you.
@errantEmber I know. I know we're going to be okay
@errantEmber [he leans in to kiss her, wrapping his arms around her waist.]
@errantEmber I fucking adore it. Because I adore you.
@errantEmber Hoooooooly shit. You're gonna kill me, you know that?
Oh man, happy anniversary to -me- cc: @errantEmber https://t.co/ZeqypeRdb4
Two years. Feels like forever.
Happy anniversary to @errantEmber. The past year has been really fucking hard, but I know I'm always steady when I'm with you.
@NotADeadHoofer //
Off to Italy.
@errantEmber Me too. [he grins, wrapping an arm around her waist.]
@errantEmber It's been a hard year. So I thought we deserved this.
@errantEmber [he grins, kissing her cheek.] I'm glad you can get away.
@errantEmber Just us.
@errantEmber [he grins.] Carol is going to stay overnight to take Simon. We'll be flying back in Tuesday.
@errantEmber We've been married two years. And it's been a hard year. So I thought I would do something special.
@errantEmber I got us tickets to go to Italy.
@IronPep I understand. I bet a lot of people will be doing the same thing.
@errantEmber Hey, is it too late for you to not be in London tomorrow?
@IronPep [he wraps an arm around her shoulders, sighing.]
@IronPep [he kisses her cheek before grabbing a beer.] Ready to cry?
@IronPep With beer? Of course with beer.
@IronPep I'm assuming I should go watch that and cry.
@IronPep And she quotes Hamilton. Man, that's hot.
@IronPep Hell no you don't. You're Pepper goddamn Potts. You're a badass.
@IronPep I totally understand. It's so easy to be feel jaded by the entire process.
@IronPep I mean, they're pretty equally awful.
Holy shit, there's a rubber band machine gun? I NEED IT.
Oh man, I love coffee so much.
Putting some time in at the range.
Everything worked out really well, actually.
@errantEmber TXT: worse comes to worse, we have boxed pasta.
@errantEmber TXT: we'll find out when we boil it. It also could be flour with a side of egg paste.
@errantEmber TXT: we did. we napped and we made pasta. most likely.
@errantEmber TXT: Si and I made you dinner! Maybe. We'll see.
We'll test it out on Momma when she gets home, okay?
Alright, so, we either made pasta or flour with a side of egg.
@errantEmber TXT: hey, I'm staying home with Si today.
Can't find the energy to get out of bed today.
@errantEmber They're soldiers, that's all they know how to do. [he shook his head, sighing.] Sorry. This is stupid.
@errantEmber Oh, they just called me old. Yknow, never going out anymore. Boring.
@errantEmber Just some stuff the guys said yesterday. 's stupid.
@errantEmber I dunno. I mean, I don't really go out as much anymore.
@errantEmber I'm not boring, right? Just because I don't go out to bars anymore?
@errantEmber Hey. I'm not...boring, am I?
Fuck off, alright?
Yeah, yeah, I know. I don't gamble, I don't drink anymore. Almost like I'm trying to be a good dad to my kid.
No, no, just gonna spend it with the wife and kid. We'll catch up another time.
Nah, that doesn't mean I'm Boring Old Barton, fuck you.
Nah, guys, I'm gonna pass on going out tonight. I don't do that anymore.
Yes, Si, your Da is very old today.
Thirty seven. Oof.
@errantEmber Sure. That sounds really nice.
@errantEmber Sure thing. Want me to grab the monster?
@errantEmber Eeeey. [he grins and wraps his arms around her.] Lets go.
@errantEmber Where do you want to go?
@errantEmber Want to get lunch?
@errantEmber Well thanks, sweetheart. I love you.
@errantEmber Well thanks, sweetheart. I love you.
@errantEmber I'm okay.
@errantEmber I'm just saying. I'm okay and you're incredible.
@errantEmber [he grins, leaning in to kiss her.]
Oh man I understand that. cc: @errantEmber https://t.co/eSpaXpqmAh
Awh, Si, I love you, kid, but you're getting on Da's nerves tonight.
@RazzleDazzly I'm just saying, I've seen worse people in better positions.
@RazzleDazzly Nah, Tony, I'm not worried, not when you're in the driver's seat.
@RazzleDazzly I'm glad you got it during the holiday-ish time. Are you and Steve tucked away or are you in New York?
Guys who blast obnoxious metal at the gym are the worst kind of people.
Since I can't fucking drink.
I've been smoking a lot more, I've noticed.
Sharing a glass of wine with @errantEmber and it's very hard to not drink the whole damn bottle.
@IronPep Oh fuck yeah. I'm so excited.
@IronPep You go, girl.
@errantEmber It's no problem. It was nice taking it easy with you and Si.
@errantEmber Good. [he smiles and leans in to kiss her forehead.]
@errantEmber Hey, how are you feeling?
@irishwhips So funny. I love it.
@irishwhips Haaaaaaaaaa.
@RazzleDazzly Exactly. It's getting around it and not fucking up everything that's hard. How was your New Year's Eve?
@RazzleDazzly You're pretty great, Tony.
Making @errantEmber breakfast in bed. Si is on coffee duty.
As always, @errantEmber is my New Years kiss.
I'm...trying to not get drunk tonight.
@errantEmber [he smiles, grabbing his phone.] Ill make reservations.
@errantEmber Great. [he leans in to kiss her.] Want to go out to dinner?
@errantEmber [he laughs, leaning in to kiss her.] Wanna stay in?
@errantEmber Hey. What are your plans tonight?
Napping on my desk today. The rest of the year can suck it.
Can people stop dying holy shit.
All I want is a beer, holy shit.
Okay. Trying this whole sober thing again.
@IronPep What the fuuuuuuuck.
Princess Leia died what the fuck.
Clearing the liquor out of the house.
@errantEmber I got sorta mean last night. You really are doing everything you can, with me and Si and the company. And you're doing great.
@errantEmber I should. I know I've been shitty. Especially to you.
@errantEmber I know. I should have been. But I didn't. And I'm sorry.
@errantEmber I know. I haven't been doing so great with sobriety lately.
@errantEmber Eight. I actually put Si to bed drunk.
@errantEmber How...how much did you think I had to drink that night?
@errantEmber You're welcome, baby. I'm sorry about the other night. I went a little overboard.
Merry Christmas, @errantEmber. Love you. https://t.co/eHxpzrTrzL
Nothing like being woken up by a kid jumping on your bed babbling loudly about Santa in a half-American, half-English accent.
@errantEmber I'm okay. Just okay.
@errantEmber You shouldn't. You're beautiful and talented and our son is great.
@errantEmber But you're doing so fucking well. You've barely made any mistakes.
@errantEmber married that got a fucking OUI.
@errantEmber I'm okay. But compared to who you are? Shit, Em. You're known for being so smart and savvy and I'm the American she --
I should probably stop doing that since Si will be old enough to read soon.
Every year. Not sorry, @errantEmber. https://t.co/V3PpO7fAKp
Skipped work on Friday. Felt like hell and it's Christmas anyway.
@AgentRomanova Are you leaving already?
@AgentRomanova I know. But I should. I want to support Emily.
@AgentRomanova It's because I need to dress up to impress them. I hate these money suits.
@AgentRomanova I just really hate being all dressed up at events like this.
@RazzleDazzly He does, he's loud like dad and opinionated like mum. Behaved like a gentleman at Emily's Christmas party.
@AgentRomanova I'm fine. It's fine.
@RazzleDazzly London's okay. Yknow. I'm still partial to New York but Si seems to like all the lights. You spending a quiet New Years too?
@RazzleDazzly Same, man. How's New York? All lit up?
@RazzleDazzly Merry Christmas, Tony.
@AgentRomanova [he took a sip of his beer, sighing.]
@errantEmber Because you are so talented an am now a business owner. Nothing wrong with that.
@errantEmber [he rubs a hand over his face, shaking his head.] No, no. It's not your fault. You've always been so great and so amazing.
@AgentRomanova Awh, you're sweet. [he clinks his glass against hers.]
@errantEmber I don't know. I don't know why I care so much. I don't want to.
@AgentRomanova Cheers. To my favorite Russian spy.
@irishwhips Cool. I'm down for that.
@errantEmber I know you don't. But I do.
@errantEmber None of them think so.
@errantEmber I just hate feeling like I'm not good enough for you.
@errantEmber 's fine. I should know by now. What it's like. What I'm like.
@errantEmber [he digs out his cigarettes, fumbling with the lighter as he lights the cigarette.]
@errantEmber [he closes his eyes, sighing.] Fine. Okay. Let's...let's just get out of here.
@irishwhips Would you tell me with your mouth?
@irishwhips Basically I'm going to tell you you're great until you get annoyed with mu voice and you tell me to shut up.
@irishwhips I can be pretty persuasive.
Joke's on her - I drank before we came here, too.
I can't believe she's doing this.
@errantEmber [he closes his eyes, leaning his head back.] Fine. Fine. I'll leave. Protect the precious company. I'm going for a smoke.
@errantEmber Are you serious? Em. 'm -fine-. I'm not embarrassing you like you're always so worried about at these parties.
@errantEmber I'm seriously fine. Really. Let's just kiss and hen you can go back to everything.
@irishwhips [he smiles, winking.] You should.
@errantEmber small talk. Not causing any trouble.
@errantEmber Uh oh, I'm getting kicked out already? [he wraps an arm around her waist.] Cmon. I'm fine. I'm out of the way, making --
@irishwhips Maybe. I'm gonna err on the side that you're great always.
@irishwhips All of the time, yes.
@errantEmber Maybe because I just like you a lot.
@errantEmber What? [he snorts, shaking his head.] 'm barely even buzzed, baby.
@errantEmber [he smiles, weaving a bit on his feet.] Thanks, love. Merry Christmas.
@AgentRomanova [he comes back with a glass, handing her one.]
@irishwhips God you're great.
@errantEmber 'm not that tired. Yknow. It's a pastry, it's fun, or whatever.
I just want to get out of here.
She'd be pissed if she know how much I had to drink before I put Simon down.
@AgentRomanova Sure thing. I'll go grab it for you.!
@AgentRomanova What do you want? I'll get it for you.
@IronPep Nah, nah, 'm fine. Cmon, Pep. Have some fun.
@errantEmber 'm fine. Just, been' making conversation with the bartender. Yknow.
@AgentRomanova Not investors. [he smirks.] Want a drink?
@errantEmber Glad I could help. [he kisses her cheek.]
@errantEmber [Clint comes up behind her, placing a hand on her lower back.] Hey, sorry, but the little monster wants to see his mom.
@errantEmber TXT: want me to rescue you from that conversation because that dude looks like he sucks
@AgentRomanova Nah, nah. My wife's. Shes a businesswoman and everyone is awful.
@AgentRomanova And I don't think the world is going to be getting quiet any time soon.
@errantEmber TXT: gonna go see how Si's doing
I wasn't going to get a fucking chip anyway. Waste of time.
@AgentRomanova Yknow. The regular. Working for what seems like forever.
@IronPep [he pours her a glass, some of it spilling over the side.] Cheers.
Drunk.
@AgentRomanova What else have you been up to? Other than kicking ass.
@AgentRomanova I'll see what I can do. I've missed working like that.
Em is off making conversation. I'm just going to hang by the bar.
@AgentRomanova I really do too. [he bumps his shoulder against hers.]
@AgentRomanova Of course it did. You're the one that was there.
@AgentRomanova Where was it? I assumed that you kicked ass.
Si's asleep. I guess I should head back down.
@AgentRomanova I'm okay. Yknow. How are you?
@AgentRomanova You bet. I absolutely did.
Okay, Si. One last book.
@AgentRomanova Awful, Tasha. Awful.
Glad to get away from this fucking party.
@errantEmber [he nods, leaning in to kiss her.] I'll be back soon.
@errantEmber Yeah. Is his bag already up there?
@errantEmber That sounds great, actually. [he downs the whiskey, placing the glass upside down.] I'll see you in a bit?
@errantEmber [he nodded, glancing over at her.] I'm going to go hang it with Si.
@errantEmber [his nerves were settling as he motioned for another drink.] Good. That's great.
@errantEmber Okay. Good. [he runs a hand through his hair, nodding.] Seems to be going good, though.
@errantEmber How's he been to Si?
@errantEmber Fine. Yknow. Avoiding your dad. So fine.
@errantEmber [he looks over at her, smiling, already a little drunk.] Hey.
No, neat. Thanks.
I'm going to have another scotch, yeah.
Just shared looks with Emily's dad.
Yeah, scotch, neat, please.
Bar? Bar.
I'm fucking nervous.
@errantEmber [he runs a hand through his hair, smiling down at Simon.]
@errantEmber Okay. Good. [he sighs, picking up Si.] Let's go.
@errantEmber [he grimaced, looking up at her.] That obvious?
@errantEmber Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready to go.
It's the first time I've seen her parents since...since crashing my car.
@errantEmber Thanks. You look amazing.
Ready to party with @errantEmber tonight. https://t.co/1pKFejk96S
@errantEmber Obviously. [he smirks.]
@errantEmber Yeah, yeah. [he leans over, tapping his phone to change it to Christmas music.] Better?
Dancing around the kitchen with @errantEmber. She's tolerating country music - though that may also be the wine.
@_Lightbreaker Marshmallows are pretty great.
@_Lightbreaker So true. Best with whiskey.
Like, so cold I want to die, cold.
It's fucking cold.
@errantEmber The small stuff like that.
@errantEmber That's why i got you to marry me.
@errantEmber Charming is a word. [he smirks, opening his drawer and pulling out a few ties.]
@errantEmber He helps. More than I do.
@errantEmber He can sweet talk all the people you're trying to impress.
I'm trying. For real this year.
@errantEmber I thought we could match. Have Si in a red shirt or something.
@errantEmber [he smiles against her lips, wrapping his arms around her waist.] Want to help me pick out a tie?
@errantEmber [he laughs, shaking his head.] Aw, thanks.
@errantEmber Yeah. I haven't picked a tie yet, though. I want it to match your dress.
@errantEmber You're welcome.
@errantEmber All of them are good on you.
@errantEmber What color is your dress?
@errantEmber When's your holiday party? This week, right?
Whoaaa. https://t.co/SMEgC3A4p4
Nothing like spinning out and almost crashing my car. I love London.
@irishwhips Whoa.
@errantEmber I love you too, Emily.
@errantEmber I'm glad I got someone as forgiving as you.
@errantEmber your life forever.
@errantEmber [he snorted.] Remember when you found out I was Clint, instead of Barney? I thought you were going to throw me out of --
@errantEmber [he begins to play with her hair, smiling softly.] How did I get so lucky?
@errantEmber [he had changed into joggers, setting his phone aside as she crawled into bed.] Hey.
@errantEmber [he watches her go, tossing the clothes in the hamper before heading to the bedroom.]
@errantEmber That sounds good to me. [he leans in to kiss her quickly.] Love you.
@errantEmber [he kisses her back, running a hand through her hair.]
@errantEmber I got it. [he squeezes her gently before kissing her shoulder, sliding out of her.]
@errantEmber We don't have to. But, I think the bed might be better for what's next.
@errantEmber [he wraps both arms around her, grinning into her shoulder.]
@errantEmber [he just breathes out a laugh in reply, taking the hand off of her, and placing it on her stomach.] I fucking love you.
@errantEmber [she clenches around him, hard, as he follows her, heat spiking up his spine as he works her through it.]
@errantEmber [he thrusts into her had, changing the direction of his thumb as he digs his fingers into her hip, stomach tight.]
@errantEmber C'mon, Em. [his pace picks up, breathing hard against her shoulder.]
@errantEmber [he loves the way he feels around her, hot and tight. he kisses her shoulder as he thrusts into her, breathing out sharply.]
Undercover Boss sometimes makes me cry like a little bitch.
@errantEmber [he groans her name, leaning his against his shoulder as he changes his pace.]
@irishwhips That sounds amazing.
@irishwhips Oh fuck yes. Are they footie pajamas?
@irishwhips Shit. That sounds incredible. Clothes optional, right?
@irishwhips God, that sounds like an incredible Christmas.
@errantEmber I'm all yours, Em. To get like this whenever you want me to.
@irishwhips I know what to get you for Christmas.
@irishwhips Chocolate is pretty amazing.
@irishwhips Chocolate is pretty amazing.
@errantEmber [he thrusted into her hard, nipping along her shoulder.] Not gonna, baby.
@errantEmber You're incredible. You know that? You drive me crazy every day and I fucking love it.
@errantEmber [he rests his forehead against her shoulder, groaning her name.]
@errantEmber [he changes the pace of his hips, groaning at the feel of her around him.]
@errantEmber [he grins at her groan, pressing kisses to the back of her neck.]
@irishwhips Candy pumpkins are the best candy.
@errantEmber [he reached forward, rubbing at her clit, thrusting his hips into her.]
@errantEmber [he moves a hand to her lower back, groaning.]
@irishwhips Also, candy.
@errantEmber [he sighed, pushing into her again.] I love you, Emily.
@errantEmber You feel so amazing, baby. [he groaned, digging his fingers into her hip.]
@irishwhips Halloween is pretty great.
@errantEmber [he slides into her slowly, groaning.]
@irishwhips Neither my brother or I have super been into the holidays.
@irishwhips Oh, yeah. I remember that one, I think.
@errantEmber [he steps out of his own boxers, rubbing a thumb into her hip.]
@errantEmber That's part of the point, doll. [he grins and tugs at her underwear, sliding it down.]
@irishwhips It's totally weird, no doubt.
@errantEmber And I love leavin' them on you.
@irishwhips Do you like the Santa Clause?
@errantEmber [he grinned, tightening his teeth a little more before letting go.] Going to have a few extra jewels for your holiday party.
@errantEmber God, you're beautiful. [he moaned softly and sunk his teeth into her shoulder.]
@errantEmber [he groaned, pausing for a second before pushing her shirt over her head, down her arms.]
@errantEmber [he hikes it up around her ribs.] Lift your arms.
@errantEmber [he takes a step closer to her, slipping his hands up her shirt, dragging his fingertips down her sides.]
@errantEmber [he undoes the button on his own pants, taking his shirt and tossing it aside.]
@errantEmber I can imagine. Because you do the same damn thing to me. Now get those pants off.
@errantEmber [he finally lets go, kissing down her neck.]
@errantEmber [he obliges, digging his fingers into her hips.]
@errantEmber [he grins wolfishly at her as he steps forward, biting a bruise into her neck.]
@errantEmber [he nods, grabbing his drink to toss it back.] Yeah. That'll work.
@irishwhips We can go back to my place and watch Christmas movies. Or dumb horror movies.
@errantEmber How about this fucking bar? [he grins, smacking her ass.] C'mere.
@irishwhips [he smiles as he kisses her.] Want to go get a drink?
@errantEmber Mm, and I'll gladly take the blame.
@irishwhips You do both. Maybe one better than the other. [he smirks, kissing her.]
@errantEmber Jesus. [he digs his fingers into her waist, grinning.] You're a minx.
@irishwhips There's a lot of truth to that.
@irishwhips You're a fighter. Kicking ass in more ways than one.
@errantEmber Yeah? You think about this when you're in your meetings? With all the execs?
@irishwhips I'm glad you made the decision.
@errantEmber I love -you-. You drive me wild, Emily.
@irishwhips Yeah, it could be.
@errantEmber [he wraps his arms around her waist, sliding her closer to him. he moves their drinks out of the way, nipping her neck.]
@errantEmber [he finally pulls back, kissing down her jawbone.] I love you.
@errantEmber [he twists a hand in her hair, deepening the kiss.]
@errantEmber You'll certainly have a good time here. [he clinks his glass against hers.]
@errantEmber Come here often, sweetheart? [he leans in to kiss her temple, handing her the drink.]
@errantEmber [he hummed to himself as he made the drinks, listening as Emily bid Si goodnight.]
@errantEmber [he smiles, smacking her ass before moving to the kitchen.]
@irishwhips [he kisses her cheek again, rubbing her back.]
@irishwhips It must be hard not being around them.
@irishwhips When did it start?
@irishwhips No, I get it.
@irishwhips [he wraps his arms around her, kissing her cheek.]
@irishwhips [he squeezes her shoulder.]
@errantEmber I'll make some drinks.
@irishwhips I bet it makes you miss Canada.
@irishwhips Is it nice, having them around?
@errantEmber Yes. Let's totally do that.
@errantEmber [he wraps his arms around her waist, pulling her close.]
@irishwhips That sounds great. How are they?
@errantEmber [he's taken by surprise, kissing her back firmly.]
@irishwhips Are you going anywhere special?
@errantEmber I love you too. Forever, yeah?
@irishwhips You look amazing.
@errantEmber You're sweet. [he kisses get forehead.]
@irishwhips So good.
@irishwhips [bug eyes] Whoa.
Throwback to two Christmases ago. She looks the same because she's more superhero than me. Love you, @errantEmber. https://t.co/3vq0rGsSGd
@errantEmber I did. I wanted to treat you.
@errantEmber [he wraps his arm around her shoulders, smiling as he gave the waiter his name.] Its cold outside.
@errantEmber I thought we should. It's been a while.
@errantEmber Good. I'm glad. [he grins, taking her hand.] Cmon.
@errantEmber Nooo. What? [he smirks, leaning in to kiss her.]
@errantEmber Hi. [he hurriedly stubs out his cigarette.]
@errantEmber TXT: I'm outside.
@errantEmber TXT: love you.
@errantEmber TXT: 11 Upper Saint Martin's Lane.
@errantEmber TXT: out. :)
@errantEmber TXT: Cool. Si is with Carol.
@errantEmber TXT: dinner tonight? My treat?
Almost lost my keys this morning. Everything is fine.
It's not often that I'm at work later than Em.
@errantEmber [he wraps an arm around her shoulders.] Hungry?
@errantEmber [Clint smiles and gives her a kiss on her cheek.] We missed you.
@errantEmber [Simon runs up to her first, closely followed by Clint.] Hey, Mum. How was your day?
@errantEmber TXT: Si and I will be waiting for you.
@errantEmber TXT: I'll pick up dinner. Italian okay?
@errantEmber TXT: lunch and a little bit of hookey?
I tried to quit smoking after I got home from overseas. Turns out, I'm really bad at quitting things.
@errantEmber It starts at seven.
@errantEmber Yeah. Family of the kid that died over there, too.
@errantEmber [he smiled, leaning in to kiss her.] They wanted to meet the amazing Emily Barton-Moore.
@errantEmber O'Neils. They booked out an area of it.
@errantEmber The guys from my unit are getting together for dinner. I'd like you and Si to come.
@errantEmber Hey, what are you doing Friday?
@errantEmber Si, why don't you go grab Mum a mug for her coffee?
@errantEmber We've got a chef on our hands. [he smiled, picking Si up.]
@errantEmber [Clint grins, leaning in to kiss her cheek.] C'mon. The Monster is starving. And so am I.
@errantEmber Nah, I just gave our two-year old a knife and was like, eh, fuck it, it'll be fine.
@errantEmber I helped him. He didn't have the knife to himself.
@errantEmber A scramble, with onions and peppers and home fries and eggs. Si helped me chop the potatoes.
@errantEmber Si and I cooked tons of food - and we need your help to eat it all, Momma.
Si and I woke up @errantEmber for breakfast!
Spent the whole day in bed with @errantEmber and Si watching Christmas movies.
Nope.
I never really used to mind kid-dying movies, but after Si...
@errantEmber I fucking love you too, Emily.
@errantEmber [he wraps his arms around her, dragging his fingertips down her spine.] We're not that far off.
@errantEmber [he laughs softly, untucking her shirt.] Yeah? Maybe I should go all gray.
@errantEmber Yeah? [he moves a bit closer to her, slipping a hand under her shirt.] How hot?
@errantEmber It is not that hot. It makes me old.
@errantEmber [pouts.] Ow.
@errantEmber At least none of it was gray this year.
@errantEmber [laughs, leaning in to kiss her.] I guess.
@errantEmber Okay, okay. [he rubbed his clean-shaven face.]
@errantEmber It would be so festive!
@errantEmber Yesyesyesyes. It's gonna be -great-.
I'm going to keep the beard and buy beard ornaments and @errantEmber can't stop me.
@errantEmber Whaaaat who me?
@errantEmber [she clenches around him as she cries out and he's not too far after her, digging his fingers into her hips.]
@errantEmber Nothin' can pull me away from you, baby. [he half-groans it, changing his pace.]
@errantEmber [he tugs at her hair, groaning as she clenches around him.]
@errantEmber Fuck -yes- I do. [he drags his fingertips down her side, thumb rubbing at her.]
@errantEmber You drive me crazy. Every day, you know that?
@errantEmber [he twisted one hand in her hair, another resting on the wall as he rocked into her.]
@errantEmber God, Emily. [he groans at the feel of her, pressing his body against hers.]
@errantEmber [he finally pushes into her, groaning.]
@errantEmber Yes ma'am. [he moves her legs, wrapping them around his waist, brushing against her.]
@errantEmber [he watches her, grinning before tugging off his boxers.] I fucking -love- you.
@errantEmber Back up against that wall. I'm going to wrap you around me and fuck you until you scream.
@errantEmber Meant to. [he grins, stepping back to kick his pants off.]
@errantEmber Good. It's what I do. [he tugs her underwear and it rips.]
@errantEmber [he grins, wrapping his fingers in the band of her underwear.] You're fucking beautiful.
@errantEmber I know. And I love it. [he nips her neck one last time.] Get those fucking pants off.
@errantEmber Yeah? [he grins, pressing his hips against hers.] I love taking it from you.
@errantEmber I fucking -adore- it. Watching you get all dressed up in heels and the marks I put on you.
@errantEmber Proper Misses Moore is going into board meetings with hickeys. [he grins, leaning in to make another mark.]
@errantEmber I know. [he grins and leans in to nip at her neck, intending to leave a mark.]
@errantEmber I love you too. To the moon and back, Em. [he presses her up against the wall, popping the button on her jeans.]
@errantEmber Jesus Christ. [he grins and sinks a hand into her hair.]
@errantEmber [he reaches around to undo her bra and flicking it across the room.]
@errantEmber Yes. Yes, yes yes. [he works at her shirt, pulling it off.]
@errantEmber Naaaah. [he grins and leans in to kiss her.] Love you.
@errantEmber You're perfect.
@errantEmber I like that idea. I'm sure we'll be able to tire the monster out.
@errantEmber Great. Anything scheduled with your mom?
@errantEmber Great. [he leans in to kiss her.] Doing a company holiday party again this year?
@errantEmber I'm sure we do. Maybe the real one in he living room, fake one in the dining room?
@errantEmber [Clint grins as Simon starts singing along.] I'll move stuff around to make sure we have enough room.
@errantEmber We have room for both?
@errantEmber [he laughs] Yeah? I'll look at a few places so we can go pick one up.
.@errantEmber is so ready to start decorating for Christmas. I don't know where she gets it.
Once in a while the bow comes out and it feels great. She feels great.
@errantEmber [he kisses down her jaw, pushing her shirt up.]
@errantEmber [he brings her into the bedroom, tossing her onto the bed.]
@errantEmber [he lifts her up, wrapping her legs around his waist.]
@errantEmber [a grin splits his face.] Hell yeah.
@errantEmber And you're the best thing that's ever happened to me.
@errantEmber He's the greatest thing I've ever done.
@errantEmber It's also pretty cute when he switches between your accent and mine.
@errantEmber [he laughs, running the back of his head.] Sorry.
@errantEmber That and leaping off of the back of the couch. That's all me too.
@errantEmber It's insane. He gets it all from you.
@errantEmber [he leans in to kiss her again.] Si knew something was wrong.
@errantEmber It's not fine. What I did was shitty.
@errantEmber And I'm sorry. About everything earlier. I was an asshole and paranoid.
@errantEmber Much. [he leans in to kiss her.] I love you.
@errantEmber It was a great trip.
Finally home. Teaming up with @errantEmber to put the monster to bed.
@errantEmber It's not your fault.
@errantEmber Yeah. It's usually because we're fighting about other stuff when I throw insults at your dad.
@errantEmber I've said some pretty nasty things to him. And about him.
@errantEmber dad, and even you, go into that category.
@errantEmber It's not just that. There's a step in AA. It's like, coming to terms with people you've hurt because of your drinking. Your --
@errantEmber I know. But I have to at least try, right? Even if he just wants to talk about how terrible I am.
@errantEmber I just want to mend fences. Especially with your father.
@errantEmber I've been doing a lot of thinking. And being in AA and all...your parents have never seen a good side of me.
@errantEmber I was thinking...we should have dinner with your parents.
@errantEmber I am too. But it was needed. To get away from everything.
@errantEmber Cheers. [he taps his bottle against hers.]
@errantEmber Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.
@errantEmber [he comes back around half an hour later.] He's finally out.
@errantEmber Yep. [he throws Si over his shoulders.] Cmon, monster.
@errantEmber ["No!"] Yeeeah, bud. C'mon, we've got a long drive to home tomorrow.
@errantEmber You're still amazing.
@errantEmber He's amazing. Just like his Momma. [he leans in, kissing her.]
@errantEmber [Simon crawls on his lap, thrusting out a picture he drew.] Man, Si, that's incredible. You're an artist.
@errantEmber One day.
@errantEmber Let's stay here forever.
@errantEmber Yeah. I know.
@errantEmber Si asked if everything was okay between us.
Streaming the Thanksgiving Day parade with Simon. He's totally entranced.
@irishwhips That's what I thought too.
Drunk with @errantEmber in Scotland.
He knows something is going on between Em and I. He's too perceptive for a toddler.
Safely in Saint Andrews. Si is running around, exploring our rental.
Safely in Saint Andrews. Si is running around, exploring our rental.
@errantEmber Sounds good. I can do that.
@irishwhips Yeah. Suddenly you're ten years older.
@errantEmber I'll pick up stuff for dinner.
@irishwhips Day to day shit is the worst.
@irishwhips [he laughs, shaking his head.]
@irishwhips Its on top of a list.
@errantEmber Great. [he nods, running a hand through his hair.] I'll see you at home in a bit?
@irishwhips Ever think about going again? Just for the fuck of it?
@errantEmber And...do you still want to go to Saint Andrews?
@errantEmber [he nods.] I'll cook something for dinner, too.
@errantEmber Yeah. Yeah, I'll...I can leave you alone for a bit with Si if you want.
@errantEmber Do you want to go home?
@errantEmber [he stared down at her desk, sighing.]
@errantEmber I'm fucking sorry, okay?
@errantEmber I know, I know, I just...i got upset and didn't stop and fucking think.
@errantEmber I didn't know what to think. I knew we were on real shaky ground before I left. And when I was gone.
@errantEmber [he nods, meeting her eyes.] And I'm sorry I jumped to conclusions so fast.
@errantEmber I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I just...jesus. I don't know.
@errantEmber I want to stay with you. I love you, Emily. Even though we fight like this.
@errantEmber What are we going to do?
@errantEmber [he folds his arms across his chest, sighing.] I don't...I don't want to fight like this.
@errantEmber You do get why I'm fucking upset, though?
@errantEmber [he closes his eyes, blowing out a long breath before looking at her.] What's wrong with us?
@errantEmber You -know- that's not what I'm trying to do, Emily. Seriously.
@errantEmber I am -not- the asshole here.
@errantEmber [he groans, dropping his head in his hands.]
@errantEmber I didn't think you did. I'm wondering now.
@errantEmber I will when you will. When your dad does.
@errantEmber You said yes to go out with someone that was in your own social class, so yeah, I'm thinking it did.
@errantEmber you almost did.
@errantEmber Well things aren't fucking normal anymore, Em. I spent the last hour thinking you had thrown this marriage away. And --
@errantEmber I had to drag that fucking answer from you. You don't see anything wrong with this?
@errantEmber I can't fucking -believe- you.
@errantEmber fucking -told- me! But no, let's keep it a secret from your own damn husband. Good idea, Em.
@errantEmber I fucking found out from a tabloid! Do you think this is fucking going well? It would have gone so much better if you had --
@errantEmber from a -tabloid-. Why can't you trust me and our own fucking marriage to -tell- me?
@errantEmber Why didn't you tell me any of this as soon as I got home? Or while I was away? Emily, I had to fucking find this out --
@errantEmber [he takes a few breathes before finally meeting her eyes.] Okay. Level with me.
@errantEmber This wasn't -just- for work. Do you think I'm that fucking -stupid-, Emily? Jesus!
@errantEmber You fucking went to -dinner- with him, Emily!
@errantEmber [he closes his eyes, running a hand through his hair.] Did you see anyone else?
@errantEmber You know what I fucking mean by friendly, Emily. Don't get all sassy on me.
@errantEmber But you still kissed him on the cheek. It looked pretty fucking friendly to me.
@errantEmber And he doesn't give a shit if you're married? Why the hell did you go out with him when you knew he felt that way?
@errantEmber Then why the fuck did you kiss his cheek, Em? Seriously. That's not a fucking working dinner.
@errantEmber another man.] Because I didn't peg you as one to cheat, Em, I really fucking didn't.
@errantEmber I was just wondering. [he shrugged one shoulder, pulling out his phone and pulling up the photos of her kissing the cheek of --
@errantEmber What did you get up to while I was away? Meet anybody new?
@errantEmber [the smile doesn't reach his eyes as he kisses her.] Hey.
@errantEmber [he comes into her office around ten minutes later, salad in hand.]
I know I shouldn't jump to conclusions - but I can't stop thinking about it:
@errantEmber TXT: Yeah. What would you like?
@errantEmber TXT: Yeah. Let's let lunch.
I feel like I'm going to throw up.
@errantEmber TXT: We need to talk. Now.
Are you serious.
@irishwhips Yeah? Does he still have it?
@errantEmber Great. [he smiles.] I'm excited to go.
@irishwhips Seriously. I grew up in the plains of Iowa.
@errantEmber Are you okay to leave Wednesday?
@irishwhips It would be fun. To see that again.
@errantEmber I love you.
@errantEmber Holy. Shit.
@irishwhips It sounds pretty great.
@irishwhips Ha. Those are the best fishing trips.
@errantEmber Me too. It'll be nice to get away from the city.
@errantEmber One of the kids overseas was from there. He wouldn't stop talking about it.
@irishwhips It must have been beautiful to see the stars.
@irishwhips Sleeping in igloos sound fucking awesome.
@irishwhips It's the only way to sleep. Period.
@errantEmber And Scotland is beautiful.
@irishwhips Exactly. Sleeping in the summer is the worst. You get all sticky.
@errantEmber Want to go up north? Scotland, maybe?
@irishwhips Now we're on the same thought. [he grins, winking.]
@irishwhips Totally true.
@errantEmber I was looking into it, a little. I wasn't sure what your schedule looked like.
@irishwhips Same. I'd rather be under ten blankets.
@irishwhips That's true. Who wants to wear pants sleeping, anyway?
@irishwhips You do you, girl.
@irishwhips Hanging out with no pants on is pretty incredible.
@irishwhips Leggings. Isn't that what they're for?
@errantEmber Hey. Wanna do Thanksgiving away from here?
Successfully convinced UNIT to give me Thanksgiving off again. Basically the only good thing about being a US citizen still.
@errantEmber Yes ma'am. [he grins, letting go of her shirt.]
@errantEmber [he grins, mood lightening.] Okay. I can do that.
@errantEmber Is that bed or... -bed-?
@errantEmber [he kisses her back, wrapping his fingers in her shirt.]
@errantEmber [he leans in to rest his forehead against hers.] Sorry, sorry. Long year.
@errantEmber Yeah, but, shit, Em. I'm turning thirty-seven.
@errantEmber Really? You honestly don't think I'm too old?
@errantEmber [he grumbles, wrapping his arms around her waist.] Fine.
@errantEmber [he pouts, trying to hide the gray.]
@errantEmber I mean. As long as you don't think I'm centuries old.
@errantEmber ...really?
@errantEmber I'm -old-.
@errantEmber Em help I have a gray hair I'm so old I'm fucking -ancient-.
Ah, shit.
No, no. That is not a gray hair.
@errantEmber You always do. [he trails his hand up her back, bunching up her shirt.]
@errantEmber Bit too long. I haven't really seen you.
@errantEmber [he slips a hand under her shirt, panting.]
@errantEmber Yeah. [he grins and leans in to kiss her.]
@errantEmber [he smiles and leans in to kiss her.] How about you show me?
@errantEmber Good. Because I'm all yours.
@errantEmber I'll still be here. You ain't getting rid of me anytime soon.
@errantEmber C'mere. [he pulls her into his lap, running a hand through her hair.] I'll be here for you. No matter what you choose.
@errantEmber It would be great to see you more. So would love to see you more, too.
@errantEmber No, no I just...I just wasn't sure if you were joking or not.
@errantEmber Are...are you serious?
@errantEmber [he sits up, making eye contact with her.] What?
@errantEmber No, no. Don't apologize. It's not your fault.
@errantEmber You'd think we'd have this ships-passing-in-the-night routine down or something.
@errantEmber [he sighs and kisses her cheek.] I love you.
@errantEmber It's so scary. I'm worried about Tony and Steve.
@errantEmber there for school or anything.
@errantEmber I know...it's probably stupid, to be upset about the elections. Since I live over here and Si won't be going over --
@errantEmber [he leans his head on her shoulder.] Thanks for doing this with me.
Splitting a bottle of wine with @errantEmber. Just like old times.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: Em and I picked out some cheese and chocolates, Si drew a picture of Iron Man and Captain America, it'll be there tmrw.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: she can share.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: also cmon baby you know you want to put a ring on this.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: you let me know what I can do to help over here.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: will do. And if you ever need to get away, you give me a ring.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: Come over. It wouldn't hurt anyone here.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: I did, yeah. Yknow.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: fuck man, I even voted.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: I mean. Not your fault.
@RazzleDazzly TXT: man, I'm sorry. Let me know if you need anything from across the pond.
@irishwhips 'm alright. I guess.
@irishwhips How are you doing?
@RazzleDazzly TXT: hey. in the wake of everything, how are you and Steve doing?
@irishwhips Shit, man. You're right.
@irishwhips Holy shit.
@irishwhips What in the actual fuck happened?
What. The fuck just happened.
What the fuck is going on.
@irishwhips Man, I don't live there anymore, but holy shit. I'm waiting with baited breath.
Hey America. Vote today. I did by absentee.
@errantEmber I know. For our family.
@errantEmber Thanks, baby. I really appreciate everything you've done for me.
@errantEmber I'm alright.
@errantEmber I'm just really lucky to have you.
Sometimes you need your best friend in your corner. I'm lucky to have @errantEmber.
@errantEmber Simon likes it.
@errantEmber Cmon, you love me and my bearded face.
@errantEmber HAHAHAHA.
Holy shit, Cubs.
Oh my god it's No Shave November I totally forgot until right now.
@RazzleDazzly Hey. Thanks for coming with me to that meeting.
@RazzleDazzly [Clint nodded, slightly satisfied with the answer. he watching Simon for a bit before speaking again.] How's New York?
@RazzleDazzly and extreme. [Simon giggles and Clint shakes his head.] Don't you repeat that word to mum, alright, Si?
@RazzleDazzly I'm not binning it. I don't -need- it. Yes, I made some really awful judgement calls but their program is fucking extravagant-
@RazzleDazzly more of a reason to despise me. Seriously, Tony.
@RazzleDazzly What, do you think I'm not taking it seriously? I am. Jesus, man. I fucking crashed my car and gave Em's dad even --
@RazzleDazzly like that his whole life. he had left his family - Simon - for six months to run away from a problem.] Well...
@RazzleDazzly [Clint twisted his fingers together, not being able to look in Tony's eyes. he was right - he had been making decisions --
@RazzleDazzly or to fill out a sheet or counseling or any of that.
@RazzleDazzly Because I don't need treatment. It was a one time thing. I fucked up, really bad, one time. That's it. I don't need treatment-
@RazzleDazzly doesn't mean I had to do it.
@RazzleDazzly No, I mean...I was sentenced to go, not necessarily participate. I got the form, yknow, kinda looked it over but that --
@RazzleDazzly We can call them problems, or whatever. I'm fine with that. But I don't think alcoholic is the right word.
@RazzleDazzly word to use.
@RazzleDazzly [he bristles at the word, setting Si down as he moves to the kitchen.] Well. I mean. I dunno if alcoholic is the best --
@RazzleDazzly [Simon nods, grabbing his crayons.] Thanks for coming all the way out here. I really do appreciate it.
@RazzleDazzly We can sit. Little man is good to run around the house while we chat.
@RazzleDazzly [Si laughs and Clint grins as he rolls his eyes.] Okay. Coffee instead?
@NotADeadHoofer TXT: Will do Cap x
@RazzleDazzly Tony.] Want some tea? Must have been a long flight, even in that.
@RazzleDazzly Ah, no, I've been a little behind on things. But I'm sure we'll catch up. [he rubbed Si's back, who was clinging to --
@RazzleDazzly whistling.] Whoa. New paint job?
@RazzleDazzly We might be. Everything has been so crazy that we actually haven't thought about it. [he looks over the suit, --
@RazzleDazzly Mum gets home.
@RazzleDazzly [Si laughs with excitement, reaching out to grab a hold of his Uncle Tony.] Perfect, wind him up with sugar before --
@RazzleDazzly fingers into the suit jacket. maybe he seeded this more than he realized - his friends.]
@RazzleDazzly [Clint is almost surprised, taken aback for a second before leaning in, wrapping an arm around Tony's waist, twisting his --
@RazzleDazzly it starts raining.
@RazzleDazzly [Clint watches Tony land with Si on his hip, who's clapping wildly.] Hey, Uncle Tony. We've got maybe a half an hour before --
@NotADeadHoofer TXT: however bad Tony says it is, it isn't that bad.
@RazzleDazzly Hey man, feel free to use the roof. We can find a place to store it in the apartment.
@RazzleDazzly Submerging into the Atlantic is probably seen as bad. Give me the heads up when you're a half an hour out.
@errantEmber [Clint kisses Si's cheek, smiling.] Hey bud.
@RazzleDazzly Took the day off. What time are you flying in?
@errantEmber Yknow, just one while I was waiting. No big deal.
@RazzleDazzly The election is only talked about a little over here, thank god. And it's okay to call them problems. They are problems.
@errantEmber No, not too long. I got us some appetizers.
@errantEmber [he smiles and stands, leaning in to kiss her cheek.] Hey, baby.
@RazzleDazzly Oh fuck, Halloween, I totally forgot.
@errantEmber TXT: xx
@RazzleDazzly Sure thing. I'll make sure we get the guest bed ready and some freakish English candy.
@errantEmber TXT: Yeah, bring the little monster.
@RazzleDazzly You okay?
@errantEmber TXT: dinner?
So excited to go home and put my face in a pint.
@errantEmber I love you too.
@errantEmber [he nods, taking one of her hands and squeezing it.] Thanks.
@errantEmber Not at all?
@errantEmber [he grits his teeth but nods.] What are they saying?
@irishwhips You sure do.
@irishwhips You sure do.
@errantEmber Slowly but surely. Has...do your parents know?
@RazzleDazzly Hey whoa, wait, I'm not forty.
@errantEmber Yeah. But. More on you. You've had to deal with me, Si, and your business.
@RazzleDazzly I thought it would be fine, I was so, so wrong.
@RazzleDazzly I tried, okay?
@RazzleDazzly I like to think I'm already woke. (Did I say that right?)
@RazzleDazzly I wondered why wake up beliebers was trending and I'm just really confused.
@errantEmber Yeah, I do. [he leans in to kiss her.]
@errantEmber Yeah. You deserve it. I want to spoil you a little.
@irishwhips You're an excellent blanket.
@irishwhips And you're nice and warm.
@errantEmber Hey. I got us dinner reservations for tonight.
@irishwhips It's pretty amazing.
Crawling into bed feels so dam good.
So ready to fall into bed.
There is no way I'm going to respond to a work email at 11:30 at night are you high.
@errantEmber No. Never.
@errantEmber I'm an alcoholic. That's bad enough.
@errantEmber All I wanted to be is a father that never was like my father. And...I'm not sure I'm doing that.
I hate these meetings.
@errantEmber [he nods, twisting his hand in her shirt.] Okay.
@errantEmber [he wraps his arms around her and lays his head on her shoulder.] ...I'm not a bad dad, right?
@errantEmber He takes his soberness really seriously. It might be helpful.
@errantEmber Yeah, I do. Tony might be coming to some of them with me.
@RazzleDazzly No worries. Feel free to come next week, if you want.
@errantEmber [he leans in to kiss her cheek.] I love you too.
@RazzleDazzly Thanks, man. That does mean a lot to me. They're usually every Tuesday.
@RazzleDazzly that kind of dad.
@RazzleDazzly I went to my first meeting last week. Didn't really sleep for days, after. Mostly because I didn't realize I became --
@RazzleDazzly Y'know. I'm not going to say no.
@RazzleDazzly No, I mean, super not a big deal. I have to go to ten AA meetings. That's it.
@errantEmber Yeah, but you love me.
Forcing @errantEmber to dance with me to country songs at night is my favorite thing.
One of the kids fractured his ankle tonight. Dealing with hat was great.
@RazzleDazzly Guardrail. No one was hurt.
@RazzleDazzly I'm fine. Just a few bruised ribs. Car is going to be out of the shop tomorrow.
@RazzleDazzly I dunno. I was in a bad place, got drunk and crashed my car. It's whatever.
@RazzleDazzly I, um. Might have gotten a DUI.
@RazzleDazzly Oh, trust me, I am. But. Got some other stuff going on too. And you're my friend, of course I worry about you.
@RazzleDazzly I mean, what's going on? Is it more than just running?
@RazzleDazzly Why do things taste like blood what is going on.
@RazzleDazzly Yo, what?
Dancing around to country music with Si in the kitchen.
@errantEmber Is the car out of the shop yet?
Another meeting tomorrow. I'm fucking dreading it.
My favorite thing is gross incompetence.
@Exoplate @errantEmber She's so fucking great.
Out to lunch with @errantember and the little man. https://t.co/oynhpO3X8q
Still can't sleep.
@errantEmber Okay. That sounds good.
@errantEmber I mean, I wouldn't mind seeing you.
@errantEmber I'm assuming you're out for the day?
@errantEmber I haven't been sleeping well.
@errantEmber I'm staying home from work today.
I haven't really been able to sleep since the meeting.
@errantEmber I love you, baby.
@errantEmber [he uses her cheek, sighing as he held her close.{
@errantEmber Okay, okay. [he moves a step closer to her, placing a hand on her shoulders.] I'll go.
@errantEmber [he nods slowly, chest twisting.] Okay. I'll do it, Em. For you.
@errantEmber [he moves to rub the back of his head, frowning.]
@errantEmber I don't...it shouldn't about me.
@errantEmber I know. But. I never...never really thought of it like that.
@errantEmber I'm sorry. It was shitty of me.
@errantEmber Did...did it really?
@errantEmber I'm so not. I crashed my car. Once.
I hate this. I absolutely hate this.
@errantEmber But I'm not drunk. I'm not a danger to Si, or you.
@errantEmber But I'm not drunk.
@errantEmber And maybe I have a beer a few times a week. That's not a problem/
@errantEmber Are you honestly calling me an alcoholic? I barely drank while you were pregnant.
@errantEmber I've slowed. We have Si now. I'm not going to get drunk in front of him.
@errantEmber I don't know what you're saying, Emily.
@errantEmber What? We had a few beers at dinner. That's not a lot. And are you saying that me liking beer got you pregnant?
@errantEmber No, what? I haven't always been a heavy drinker.
@errantEmber That was one bad day. I don't have a problem, okay?
@errantEmber I mean, I don't know if good for me is the best way to describe it.
@errantEmber Okay, okay. Jesus.
@errantEmber Emily.
@errantEmber Yeah. Sure. I, uh, got put on a big job so I'm actually not sure if I can make it.
@errantEmber [he nods, running a hand through his hair.] Yeah. Right.
I don't want to fucking do this.
Shit. Today is the first AA meeting.
@errantEmber [he nods and follows her, rubbing his eyes.]
@errantEmber [he wraps his arms around her shoulders, yawning.]
@errantEmber C'mere. [he kisses her cheek.]
I hate today.
Shit first day back. Just want to snuggle @errantEmber and Si and go to bed.

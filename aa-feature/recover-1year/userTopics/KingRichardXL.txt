P ARTY AT MALY'S PIZZA BUFFET TOMORROW FOR MAH BIRFDAY!
Well, I tore something in my leg. Don't know what is torn, but it hurts something awful. Just my damn luck.
Some girls are straight up scandalous

Fucking internet can't get a hold of itself. Smh xD http://t.co/QolJespPbD
I'm just...so done. I cannot handle these stupid women acting like I'm a game to be played. :/   I need a woman, but not like this.
Getting on twitter ain't even fun anymore. All you see is bullshit diet pills and 'secret nudes'. The fuck? I DON'T WANT NONE OF THAT.
Some girls I talk to are so rude.\nLike, total no chill.\nSMH
That moment you know you met the girl you're supposed to be with the rest of your life, and you let her leave...
@anysaaloveee it sucks that you have to pay for the one at MSAC :( I'd be there all day.
I almost fucked up a Marine and some girls Boyfriend just because I felt like it. Because I know I can. What the hell is happening to me?
Keep you in the dark, you know they all pretend...
I feel so bad for anyone that thinks pranking someone is funny. Especially when the victim hurts herself. I will find you.
Not very happy about school today, but what else is new?
Tired hurts
I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invested, making all the same mistakes and I'm just trying to correct it.
My anaconda dont wanna go to class tomorrow
@montyoum what a tease Monty, what a tease...NEVERTHELESS I will be watching...
Working out hurts my brain...
@AH_Michael You are the freaking best dude. Kicking ass and taking names, dude. Keep it up!
Woke up and sure enough, there wasn't a thing to drink 'cept water. Whatever.
In love with these thoughts of bacon...
@Pokemon Primape was a powerhouse in Gold!
I've always kind of wished I was Tyler Durdin...
I really can't make it to Wilson like I wanted to. However, I'll still try to keep in contact with everyone.
After a very long day and a Kickboxing workout, I'm thinning out, and I look damn good. http://t.co/LNLuL8Khd7
iPhone 6 is $900!?! Then Apple Pay better start donating to my research fund. (I'm looking for pie in the ocean)
I'm slowly losing my will to give a fuck.
Someone please...just spare my life...let me die a natural death...in my sleep where I belong...
So tired...kickboxing...soon...death come for me...
Must...sleep...

I am growing out a beard. This is going to be EPIC.
@IAmLindsayJones HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!
I'm all tuckered out now. Night guys.
To clarify: We're playing with the idea. No confirmation yet, but we're definitely thinking about it.
In cahoots with a fellow gamer (she's awesome) to start a youtube channel. I can't wait to see what kind of stuff we'll do!
@WilsonHSChoir So, I'm totally free next Friday. Do you know what that means? I think I'll get a visitors pass ;D
@WilsonHSChoir Found myself singing \"Red, Red Rose\" on the bus today and once more in my english class. Thanks for the memories!
You and I will accomplish great things together, my friend. I will see to it.
@careyting good, good. Let the butt hurt flow through you.
OH MY GOD PLEASE JUST MAKE THE FUCKING PAIN STOP FOR LIKE TEN MINUTES PLEASE!?!
What is with all these people retweeting the ratchet to bomb fake shit? And the fake photos? You people need Jesus.
Happy Labor Day!
@IAmLindsayJones I used to think people were battery operated, and thats what the big batteries were.for.
if there's one thing I've learned today, its never assume. That girl looked like, thirty, but she only nineteen. Like, what happened? &gt;x&lt;
Lazy smores kinda night with the family. OM NOM NOM NOM
That's what I get for trying to forgive Yazmine. She takes her frustration out on me. Fuck this, I shouldn't have given her a second shot.
@ItsWaltBitch I'm so down to get a follow. Seriously one of the funniest pages on twitter.
Gonna grab a few beers and trade war stories with my brother.
I can't sleep. Thinking about her just makes me want to keep awake.
When you chatting with her, and she keeps making you smile.\nThats a good one, right there.
@edsheeran Sing is one of the best song's I've heard in a long time. Keep it up, brah!
@naynay_pikachu I know you feel, down, lost, or even fed up. But there's so many good things ahead. Stay on board for a while longer.:)
Working on a cosplay for AX is difficult. I started so early, and I don't even think I'll be ready in time. Oh well. I SHALL TRY!
One day, when all of this is ending and I look over to you as I lay dying, I want you to remember how I lived, not how I died.
Being a Theater Major, you learn one thing:\nLife inside that room cannot blend into your everyday.\nYou would probably lose your mind XD
College Week 1: Finished\nCurrent Stats:\nMiles Walked: 13\nDollars Spent: 10\nFriends Made: 20+\nEnemies Made: 1\nHappiness Level: Extreme High
I woke up, and I swear I could feel my cells dying.
Meeting so many people, reconnecting with so many people, and just enjoying college is something else, guys.
College day 3. Shits getting seriously twisted. I love it.
Waking up this early is inhuman.
Just another great day! Colege is fun, exciting, and nostalgic! So many old friends!
https://t.co/nd7nKjZ8FS\nSo, there's going to be a Pokemon fighting game like tekken...\n*screams and jumps out a window*\nFINALLY! #Pokken
Day one complete. Score: 95/100 Good day overall.
I am too good at this college thing. I'm kicking its ass!
By the way, If you're reading this, I check on you here and there to make sure you're okay. It's just in my nature,  I guess.
Class begins in three hours...
College in the morning. Oh lawd...
Emma Watson steals my heart every day. She's just so damn stunning.

Played #FiveNightsatFreddys last night. I wasn't ready for Freddy.
I hate it when a friend is hurting.
Even though I cant see it cuz I no have cable, I'm watching #EverySimpsonsEver through the DVD sets I have. #ImAHomer
I have no fucking clue what my life has become. Oh, wait. Yeah I do. It's become the property of the United States Government.
@AH_Michael Now that's an IRL Rage Quit
I hate fake government pages. This one tried to scam me out of 300 bucks for a mortgage payment. I don't have a mortgage, dummies.
I hope I don't get murdered for this, but I think Ariana Grande is awful, as well as Iggy and Nicki. Linkin Park for life.
@TheEyeOfControl I have a car that has performed photoshop on many cars. Is that helpful?
I've been working on a plan to save the lives of many people. Too bad the Government doesn't like people helping people. #ThanksObama.
I love the movie fight club so much. I kinda wish I was Tyler Durdin...except real...
Can somebody please pass me the rosetta stone...
@sinnerisis http://t.co/Nu4MYIYAo8
@anjelicadeee I'd rather my buddies not be the ones giving it. Its bad enough they do it around me. They're kind of...well...pigs.
@anjelicadeee ...oh that is just gross. &gt;:(
Losing weight opens doors...and makes people a hell of a lot more polite. Thanks, Obama!
@anjelicadeee And what would you possibly want with a bunch of staring dudes?
@anjelicadeee Hah. I'm sure they'd like to meet you too. They wouldn't swoon if I was present though, trust me. #210lbsAndLovingIt
@anjelicadeee It's a bit more than a decent picture if these guys are swooning over you. :D I like it.
@anjelicadeee This is honestly my favorite picture of you. It's one of the few pictures of my friends on my tablet. http://t.co/n9Z3rKEHvG
@anjelicadeee When they ask me who you are, I say the you're the homegirl. They stop saying gross things about you after I say that.
@anjelicadeee Yeah, every time a friend and I are comparing girls we know, and I feel like I'm losing, I show him a pic of you. #autowin
Have you ever felt like you were going to die, and then came close by an accident? I was washing dishes, and my toaster fell in the sink.
I've seriously given up on trying to form a relationship with a girl. All they do is play games. I'm just so done. :/
I cannot brain today. I has the dumb.
When me and the homies compare women and I feel like I'm losing. I play my trump card. @anjelicadeee Thank you for winning my arguments.
Finally...210. I'm so happy and thin. Diet, exercise, and kickboxing. Liftin' weights and burning calories. I'm perfection once more.
Dave Franco kicks ass. He's going far in this business.

All my life, I have been betrayed, spit on, and treated poorly. Now I have a chance for revenge. What makes you think I'll ask for it?
@NickSwardson @ccstandup Loved seeing that show on Central. I laughed my ass off about the extreme gaming joke. Original! #toofunny
@TumblrEdits I hate math with a boiling passion
I've come to realize I'm more than prepared for college. I'm an actor, not a historian. I'll prove myself on stage. That's my calling.
College...life's greatest trial. If I can't make it here...what good am I? All my life I prepared for this. Now I'm doubting myself...
This is your life, and its ending one minute at a time.
When something bad happens, you have three choices. You can either let it define you, let it destroy you or let it strengthen you.
You an me, we have an ending to things. This isn't your road. But you come, and you'll walk it alone.
I have a message for you. Come find me. You know the way. Bring all your weapons, your convictions...
@ChesterBe Do you think you'd ever do another Collision Course? Maybe with @Eminem ?

Good Morning Vietnam #RobinWilliams
@anysaaloveee Mrs. Doubtfire
We lost one of the greats today. Robin Williams, on of my personal favroite actors...is gone. You will be dearly missed. #riprobinwilliams
Well, I'm now an amazing 210 and I feel wonderful. Exercise and healthy eating made me this lean mean, kickboxing machine.
@ChesterBe I love you guys, and your music has gotten me through some rough times. You aren't just a singer, you're an inspiration. #LP4LIFE
@anysaaloveee You and me both.

Dropped another ten ponds of fat, gained 8 muscle. Weigh 237lbs and im benching 185lbs on average, pressing 230. Getting better ;)
Next week, I get my totem. It's a old tradition of the Lakota tribe, and my cousin, being from there, is helping me get one. #nativeamerican
Eleven days...then, I start the forever fall of college.
I really want an RWBY tee shirt.
Thinking about my life starting from junior year. Just thinking about events that need changing. One in particular. I need to chill out.
If there's anything that got me through tough times, it's faith in Christ.\nAll is possible through Christ.
Every time I try to sit here and just relax, I can't.  With college right around the corner, im more nervous than ever before.
I just don't understand the idea of sleep. You cut your active time by a third, even though life is short enough...
That day in fourth grade I shaved my eyebrows and had to draw them on for two weeks. SMH
Guess who got their internet connection at home back?\nThis guy!
@RoosterTeeth RWBY has effectively dominated my life for the past year almost, and it only continues to. :D
I am in constant pain right now. Broke something in my foot. I'll be okay...right?
I've done so little these past few days, I feel like Justin Bieber.
I am super concerned with my life. Since we started three days ago, my life has been all PC gaming. :O

There are some mean girls up on twitter in the middle of the night, yelling obscenities at eachother and shit.
My brother got a new weight set. Plenty of 45lbs and 65lbs. Gonna lose weight, get toned, and hopefully lose these man tits. lol
I'm just...okay now. Like, a weight has been lifted.\nNow, in the next few months:\nWeights will be lifted.\nWORKOUT PLUS KICKBOXING!
@ChesterBe Taking that extended vacation lol
#ItsProbablyBetterThisWay
Usually, when it comes to girls, I'm pretty good at talking to them. This is the first time I've ever been this nervous and quiet.

It's four in the morning and I can't sleep. What show should I marathon?
@naynay_pikachu I'm late by three days, but Happy Birthday! I hope it kicked ass!
Over the next four days, I'll tell her. Everyone says I should, so I shall. I'm terrified though.
She means so much to me and I'm afraid to tell her how I feel. I've never been so...nervous. This is new.
@anjelicadeee its hard when you're fat. Lol
I just can't believe my mind waited until now to let me feel anything. :(
I'd really like to tell her, but I'm just so scared of losing it all. #whymustitbesohard
I just registered for class for the fall semester. I'm totally psyched for college. #ADULTSHITRIGHTHERE

When you leaned rowards me in choir the last few days, I'd have kissed you.\nIf I wasnt sure you were okay with it.
Today at the Banquet, I won Outstanding Singer and Overall Most Improved. Needless to say, I'm very humbled by all of this.
I've worked so hard to be an actor. It's starting to pay off, and I can't believe my luck!\nAnyone who said I couldn't:\nFuck you, I'm good.
I just made waves at the mt. Sac career day talking about my pilot for a sitcom. They like it! #thefutureisnow
I miss too many people already. All those knuckle heads made my day funny.
Things are totally looking up for me, for a change. I'm really psyched for the next few weeks if my luck is this good. #goodkarma

She actually makes me feel like I'm worth something. After all I've been through, all the bullshit and the liars...I've found someone real.
The symbols you have always looked to for strength are smoltering in ruin. This is what your greed has brought you.
Revenge is like a ghost... It takes over every man it touches... Its thirst cannot be quenched... Until the last man standing has fallen...

@AshKetchumTime I'll drink to that. *gets moomoo milk*
Wont Go Home Without You by @maroon5 is saying what I want to say.
.45 with one in the chamber. Fuck the world.
My life is in shambles. Complete shit. I cant continue so lost, lonely, and tired. Where do I go from here?
I actually started cutting. The one thing I was against...
Its been one hell of a week. I guess having one in the chamber at your bedside the night you miss people, especially her...not a good idea.
I want you for Christmas, #Left4Dead2
All my twitter followers, have a merry Christmas.
Seek out the grave, the one with your stone. Only then will you have the truth to you shown.
I admit defeat. Carey beat me 75-71, besting my SA-805 with his AK-12. Hectic game.
And now, the moment you've been waiting for. Carey vs. Richard in an epic battle to the death on Call of Duty: Ghosts. #theghostsarereal
@anysaalovee I no has life? XD jk
If you still like me or something,  you could have told me. Baka.
I hate girls who can't stick to just one guy, but cry when they're lonely. -_-
All these people venting their problems on fb and twitter, and im just sitting here digesting pizza.

I just cant do the whole nativity yuletide chris kringle noel thing right now.
I hope one day people stop being idiots and trust one another based on a pact. We need trust and understanding in society.
Cheaters cheat and liars lie. Thank God I'm not that kind of guy.
People say they want honesty and trust. What they want are well crafted believable lies.
That awkward moment when your friend grabs his backpack and says, \"I'll grab your sack too.\" #why
Getting two people a Christmas Gram. I wonder who? XD

My heart goes out to Paul Walker's family. My heart is heavy with your loss.
I know the truth now. They all thought the same thing. They all saw the truth. Wait till you fall. Who'll catch you now?
Expect me to come back bigger,  badder, and meaner. I'm pulling out all the stops.  #expectations
I cannot believe that this keeps happening. Fuck this. I'm back on my \"Fuck Hoes\", with a whole new hatred for blondes.

Me and mine. Now yours and ours. It sounds so fluid. &lt;3
Talking about the future kinda gets me sad.
I worked too hard and too long to make this friendship not awkward. Don't mess with it, please.
This is the part where I can see the future. No anger, mistrust, or fighting. I hope that its possible.
So, its 2013. Where are my hoverboards?
Sometimes I feel like there's nothing to live for. Then I remeber bacon.
Just under two weeks in and I feel great. Along with that, I finally think I'm no longer addicted to liquor. Things are #turningup

On a different note, my AA meetings have come to a shocking close when we found out that Jim was killing off the therapy group. #uneverkno
Decision made. Fucks tossed out the window. My head hurts from all the thinking, but what I have done is for the best. Trust me...
So fucking confused right now. There are three options. Pick one, the other, or neither. The both mean a lot to me. Maybe thats why I can't.
I still don't know. What the fuck do I do?\nI could get locked up if I do what I think she wants. I have to stay strong. #nosurrender

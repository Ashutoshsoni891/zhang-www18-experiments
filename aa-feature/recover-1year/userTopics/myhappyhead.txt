I have come to the sincere conclusion that #sobriety is not for me. If I am to survive #ptsd i need something to take the edge off. #mhsm
Totally just got lit during a recovery meeting.
@bdowphd Congrats and fingers cross too! I know that I will feel so much better when this is all over.
@bdowphd Thanks!  Good luck w/ finishing up the PhD. When do you defend? I'm hoping for Sept, Oct at the latest. *fingers crossed of course*
@bdowphd isn't actually damaging to my ears. I'll put up with the annoyance to feel better.
@bdowphd I started on the 150s for 2 weeks and then moved up to 300. It has helped me so much tho it's worth the suffering as long as it...
@bdowphd 300 XL.  Good to know there isn't any damage. It only really bothers me when I'm trying to concentrate or fall asleep.
Really, why doesn't @Hallmark make cards for mental illness?  \"Sorry for your #PTSD, get well soon.\" Oh wait.... #mhsm
@bdowphd hey, thanks for the response. What if it doesn't go away after a few weeks? Is it doing damage?
@cozyvibes Thanks, can't take total credit. We were talking about it at my smart meeting. Smart recover rocks, check it out
There's no shame. Bulimics puke. Pill heads pop pills. Druggies do drugs. Drunks, drink. Life is life. #addiction #sobrietysucks
@cozyvibes to me, AA is just another addiction to replace an addiction.
@cozyvibes thanks! I've read this article twice and shared it with my shrink. why are people so afraid to question #aa?
Nothing like an afternoon blackout #alcoholabuse #ptsd #gottadowhatyagottado #survival
You know, for those with #ptsd, #alcoholicsanonymous is a farce. \"Oh hey, I'm having a flashback\" call your sponsor. #bullshit #aa #drunk
I keep trying to change but the world keeps getting into the way. #mhsm #ptsdchat #alcoholabuse
If they want people to stop doing destructive things with their lives then they need to find a cure for #ptsd now. #mhsm
Does anyone else have intense ringing in their ears from taking #Bupropion #Wellbutrin? #mhsm #antidepressants #meds #depression
It will be nothing short of a fucking miracle if I make it through this week sober. #sobriety #alcoholic
Staying sober is sometimes like #leftshark learning dance moves. #xa #sobriety
Just the thought of starting #EMDR for my #PTSD is causing anxiety. Any tips on how to stay #sober during the process? #mhsm #xa #aa
Self forgiveness is a bitch. #Therapy #mhsm #xa #sobriety
Skipped #rehab today. Starting #EMDR next week. Oh joy. #recoveryprobs #sobriety #PTSD
\"Spiritual power comes from whatever gives us peace, hope, or strength &amp; enhances our humanity\" #xa #aa #recovery #rehab #sobriety
Starting my second month of #rehab. Never thought I'd be in this place but grateful for the help. #alcoholic #sobriety
Saddened hear that my friend from #rehab relapsed last night. Hope he can get back on track. #Sobriety #alcoholicsanonymous
One wish is to have \"normal\" people understand how hard it is to overcome #addiction. #sobriety #xa #aa #alcoholism
Rough day in #rehab because w had a sub therapist. Ready to have our regular one tomorrow. #ChangeSucks #sobriety #aa #xa
Doing better this weekend. Watching #interventions which may have not been the smartest thing! #xa #recovery #sobriety
@cozyvibes Lol! Google is the devil! An Wikipedia comes in a close second!
@AprilPreslar It's been a rough few days with withdrawals but they changed my meds and the last two days have been much better, thanks!
How many days after #alcohol detox can you feel symptoms? I'm 24 days and have cold sweats, headache, irritability... #aa #xa #Alcoholic
Same fucking stressful life except now I have to live it #sober #xa #winsomelosesome
@soberriotee The problem I'm having (especially with #aa) was that I was drinking alone, never hurting others etc...
Also if someone put a beer in front of me right now, I would drink it. #difficulty #xa #aa #gottakeepfighting
Learned today from #rehab to work the steps now to help fight these fucking cravings. Just going to meetings isn't enough #xa #aa #Sobriety
@soberriotee @Jeanne_Dee5 Talked it over in rehab 2day, decided it was important to work the steps. Working on a sponsor now
@Jeanne_Dee5 @Rebellion_Dogs Thanks for the recommendation, I'll check it out for sure!
@soberriotee @Jeanne_Dee5 thanks all, I'm headed back to rehab now and will certainly bring it up. I stayed sober last night thankfully
I've been having a lot of #anxiety lately that I'm going to relapse... #AlcoholicsAnonymous #alcoholism #sobriety #mhsm
Currently reading The 12 Alternative Steps: A #Secular Guide to #Recovery. So far, so good. #atheism #AlcoholicsAnonymous #sober
13 straight #AA meetings, 22 days #sober. Cravings out the ass. #alcoholicsanonymous #soberjanuary #alcoholic
Went to donate blood and told the nurse that I was a field researcher for an alcohol treatment facility. #rehab #alcoholism #sober
You know you are a recovering #alcoholic when you have no idea who the person is it just called you by name #soberlife #recovery #alcoholism
Another patient and I skipped #rectherapy today and went to the batting cages instead. Much more effective! #rehab #soberlife
Had to say goodbye to a friend I met in #rehab b/c he graduated today. I'm so proud of him &amp; learned so much from him over the past 2 weeks.
@AprilPreslar just checking in. Have seen you in awhile, hope all is well. All good here.
Two weeks #sober!!
Had my last drink two weeks ago today #sobriety #soberliving #alcoholism
.@BCBSM won't pay for my final three days. But if I relapse they will be stuck paying for weeks. Does that make sense? #sobriety
Don't insurance companies realize that if they want to keep costs down they have to allow for good care in the 1st place? @BCBSM #alcoholism
How the fuck does a case manager who sits in an office @BCBSM know if I'm ready  to leave #rehab even after the docs told her I wasn't ready
Fucking #insurance companies decide when you feel better. Fuck you @BCBSM
I smiled and laughed today... First time in years... Felt great. #sobriety #recovery #alcoholism
Piss test at #rehab today. Thank god I haven't cheated... #SoberJanuary #alcoholism #recovery
Group members are having difficulty remembering each others names... We laughed when we realized we were all drunk/high when we learned them
The side effects of the meds are diminishing. Wanted a drink last night bc of stress but took a #klonopin instead. #win #recovery #rehab
Ugh the #naltrexone is already making me sick, nauseous, dizzy...  Just like a hangover #alcoholism #sobriety #sober2015
Starting on #naltrexone tonight to combat my cravings for booze. They come and go. I need them to go. #alcoholism #sobriety #sober2015
Excited to go to #rehab today b/c it will be the first \"normal\" day after the holidays. #soberliving #sober #alcoholism
Today is the first day that I haven't had cravings. #sobernow #sober2015 #sobriety #alcoholism

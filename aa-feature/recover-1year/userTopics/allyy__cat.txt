@BlueEyedJen67 Haha I have no idea!
And the vision that was planted in my brain; still remains within the sound of silence.
Hello darkness, my old friend. I've come to talk with you again. Because a vision softly creeping; left its seeds while I was sleeping.
Wtf 7,000 tweets already??? Jeez, I must have a lot to say.

Ohh my word. The guy I met on the bus yesterday has now confessed to having a crush on me....I have no words?
Definitely winning at the ugly af game. Everyone always looks prettier than me. #bodydysmorphia #keeptalkingmh
@lostfrombirth63 Thanks hun
@JClancy003 Thank you
@xBr0kenWingsx Ok.
@TheSt1ck @micha3lamal Exactly!!
@AmbAdAstra That's what I'm doing right now
And I'm definitely getting sick. Sore/scratchy throat and cough. Voice hoarseness. Feeling like I got hit by a truck.
Really not feeling well, especially physically. My spine muscles are inflamed. My feet feel like I'm being poked with hot coals.
Really bad day. Again.
@Free_to_be_V You go girl!!!
@LoopNinetyThree Me too
@I_Need_Meds Shit. I clicked the wrong button. I meant to say beautiful
@xBr0kenWingsx What's going on hun?
@just_whisper_it Sometimes all your coping skills just don't work. I have those days too and they suck so bad.
I have a lotta shit to address and come to terms with.

Truth. https://t.co/7YTnAEYIJq
The smell of rain tho
Still not feeling well. But at least it's not 110 degrees out.
Feeling awful this morning. Woke up with a sore, scratchy throat and I feel like like hell warmed up.
@surelybutslowly Thanks so much!!!
@IICrsii49 I better :(
@soberboots Thanks Damien!  you're awesome
@dad2ago Indeed!
@Amy72014 Thank you!!!

@IICrsii49 Thank you
9 months clean from opiates. #na #RecoveryMonth #addiction
Warm me up and breathe me
I'm so tired. And stressed. Feeling like I can barely breathe.
@0800hangover Thank you my friend for this reminder. Xx
I need a break from my mind. #KeepTalkingMH #anxiety #bipolar #ocd #racingthoughts
@lostfrombirth63 :(
So sure of myself. Now I don't know.
Deep sadness. All of a sudden everything is crashing down on me. I sounded so confident when I talked to my brother on the phone earlier.
Went home and ate dinner and had some bonding time with one of my housemates; laughed our asses off. Now I feel sad again.
Today I have experienced a variety of emotions. Today was very rocky, had a meltdown at program, cried a lot during therapy.
I miss him so much it hurts my heart. What I wouldn't give for one of his hugs right now.
Today I saw his name on the bulletin board at my therapy clinic because he secretaries an AA meeting at the Wellness Center.
I miss my roommate that I had. I miss the friends I made, especially my best friend Neo. I miss the staff.
Passed by South E Street and Brookwood while riding the bus today. My old stomping grounds when I lived at E Street.
@roach_az Thanks my friend. You too. xo
How do you find yourself again when mental illness has taken so much away? I don't know who I am anymore. #keeptalkingmh

@roach_az Me too
@lisagarveyjones That's how I feel sometimes!! I totally get it
And not dying literally. Haha. But you know what I mean.
Listening to the crickets softly chirping outside. It's 73 degrees out. I can actually wear clothes to bed tonight without dying.
@Christi_Girl14 Ok honey. Keep me posted! Love you!
I put a My Little Pony sticker on my laptop and the back of my phone. Yes, I'm 5. I love that shit, man.
I really, really hope that tomorrow is a good day at program. I don't want a repeat of what happened on Friday. #nervous #KeepTalkingMH
@dirty30diaries Mine won't either.
@roach_az No. But I want to look into it. I'm sick of taking so many meds
Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood. Now we're talkin.

@coffeespoonie Ugh. I hate asshole nurses in the ER. Sorry you had to go through that.
@Christi_Girl14 Oh honey!! I'm so sorry :( any word yet on what it could be?
@0800hangover Oh no! I'm so sorry! Anything I can do to help?
I cannot stop watching Dance Moms. It's super addicting.
@quiet_courage Just followed you! You sure have a lot to deal with :( I'm sorry you're going through this. I'm always here if you need me!
@NadeneMarsh1 Very true, my friend. Sometimes I lose sight of that. Thank you for the perspective. xx
I wake up wanting to go back to bed. My week days are filled with thoughts of, "So when can I go to sleep again?" #depression #fibro
So for those of you who think "must be nice to be able to be in bed all day". No. It's not. It's fucking not. I don't wake up feeling better
I'm so tired still. Went to bed at 10:30, woke up at 10:00. Twelve hours. Still fucking tired. #fatigue #fibro #SpoonieProblems
@lostfrombirth63 I'm sorry :(
Even my hair hurts. My scalp is tingling.
I'm in so much pain my joints. My feet. My back. They all feel like they're being crushed. #Fibro #chronicpain #iwannacry
I am super thirsty. It doesn't matter how much water I drink,  I'm still parched.
Today was my first "good" day in months. Tomorrow remains uncertain. I'm afraid to be happy bc what if the depression returns???
@identitydiss @RebeccaLee83
@louisechatters I feel ya :/
@lostfrombirth63 My back hurts hella bad
I am wiped. #outofspoons #fibro #sciatica
Chores done. Meds taken. Shower taken. Now just relaxing and looking forward to sleeping in tomorrow.
It's too fucking hot.
It's hard to decipher a persons tone of voice through a text. All I'm getting is one word answers. Maybe I'm annoying him #lowselfesyeem

Tonight is Netflix and kind of chill. Still 86 degrees here in Santa Rosa. It got up to 111 today. I may need another cold shower.
@steffync @AFR365 @PugfatherJeff Keep fighting!! I'm here for you.
@WarriorOfDemiXx What's going on?
Seriously. https://t.co/jffeO7IkFS
I take meds that make me tired
Falling asleep...so tired. I'm trying to make it to 10:00. Idk if that's going to be a guarantee
@MontyCheev0 Exactly. My mom does the same to me
@Christi_Girl14 Oh honey :( I'm really sorry
Oh, only 95 now. Time to put a sweater on. #bayareaheatwave  #beingsarcastic
@MontyCheev0 Omg for real though! This is why I love my twitter community. The people who get it more than people IRL.
And then I just rested on the couch until my ride came. On another note, it's been wickedly hot here. #bayareaheatwave
Doing. By any means. I sat in the car crying most of the way back to program. Then my staff and I made up and hugged it out
Which I tend to do if I reach my breaking point. She told me to stop using my mental Illness as an excuse for everything which I was NOT
Bathroom. I snapped at her because she was walking way too fast and I got lost finding her. Then she called me out for flipping out on her

My eyes are dry from crying so much
Still awake...my mind is racing
@WesA1966
I feel like shit
At any second. I hate bipolar
Two hours ago, i was laughing, dancing in the car, and having fun. Now I just had a panic attack and I'm very tearful and could start crying
@WesA1966 I know. Ugh.
@RoseCabot1 @depressionnote Thank you.
@WesA1966 Mistake. Clarification: I was at home. My parents were still married then

@coffeespoonie What's the name of the song?
@emilyjvanb So sorry for your loss.
@I_AmStruggling Me too.
Fuck this day. And this night. I just make everything worse. Fml.

Just listened to Heavy by Linkin Park. You can really hear the pain in his voice. #linkinpark #restinpeacechester
Ugh, this emotional roller coaster is NOT the business. And I'm feeling so intensely too. My heart is broken and light at the same time.
In now 4 times to try to get them to shut up. Dude, we're adults. Act like it.
Omg. The housemates in the room across from me are fighting like school girls. We're all grown ass adults. My house manager has had to come

@I_AmStruggling Relapses happen. It's ok, don't beat yourself up.  I relapsed tons of times. Message me if you need to.

@Ihatethisugh1 True!
And I don't want to ask anyone for anything. It fucking kills me to do that. October is my SSI hearing. And I better get that shit.
No food stamps. Nothing.
I really, really don't like having no money. No cash on hand. Can't put a single dollar in the bank because the IRS will seize it.
@Ihatethisugh1 I can roll with that :D I like your perspective
@ixvisiblegirl @sheisdying_ Me too.
Today was such a mess.
I hadn't seen her in years, but I always saw her mom at my work when I lived in LA. My heart is just so sad.
Absolutely stunned. Just found out one of my childhood friends passed away last year.

I'm so overstimulated. My head is at full capacity to take in any more information right now.
No binge food or snacks to eat when I get home. Fuck this shit. I really don't like this whole not having money thing.

I have absolutely no patience for anyone or anything today. Please forgive me.
@alexdaviespbts Not much either of us can do. But thank you for being supportive and being there for me.

@mama_gracie5
If I have to stop watching, I will. I need to look out for myself.
Considering how easily triggered I get and how sensitive I am and as a person living with mental illness who has/have struggles with SI.

Friday niiiight, and I'm just chillin. Eating ice cream. Binge watching 13 Reasons Why on Netflix. Good idea? Bad idea? Not sure yet.
Man...today is fucking rough. #KeepTalkingMH #fatigue #depression
I swear this seat belt is going to choke me.
@lonelilygirl Of course xo
Thank god.
@AmbAdAstra Thanks friend!
@centre_recovery Ah, i might look into that. Thanks!
@lonelilygirl My mom is too. I'm so sorry she's abusive to you. I'm here for you
My asthma flares are just the icing on the cake.
Didn't make it to any meetings tonight unfortunately. My costochondritis is flaring up big time. And my poor feet are still swollen.
@centre_recovery Maybe you're right. I should, huh? Except the buses stop running at like 9:00
Debating whether to go an AA meeting tonight or stay home and eat myself into oblivion. #BED #itstoopeopleyoutside #ugh
@CarrieFairygirl Hugs. I'm struggling with all those too
@knuf1985 Aw man :( I'm sorry!
@justcatchmedemi I was bullied a lot too. It takes a long time to heal from.
@susi2010 @I_AmStruggling It really is :(
@dirty30diaries Wish I was
@I_AmStruggling You can do it! I have 4 months of sobriety. I've relapsed tons of times and always got sober. I'm here if you need anything
@depressionnote Oh my god. That's awful I'm so sorry you had to go through that.

@knuf1985 Hahaha omg
@knuf1985 I know. Idk what it is :(
Come back clear. Again, wtf?
I have asthma and have had respiratory problems since birth, the cough's been around for a couple weeks at least. And all my chest xrays
And I've had this horrendous cough that hurts my chest, I cough up shit, my inhalers don't help. I still wheeze, especially at night.
So what the fuck? Idk what this could be from.
My feet and ankles have been swollen for three weeks now. Been to the ER twice. Had labs done, EKG, chest xray, ultrasound. All looks okay.
Now if my feet would stop being swollen so I can wear shoes again. That would be great. #SpoonieCommunity, do you experience this?
@knuf1985 Oh no!!! That sucks big time. :((
@willowperkinson @Christi_Girl14 Oh my gosh, thank you so much for updating us!
@LaciLou77 @Christi_Girl14 Just sent her another DM
@missssmeghanxo I'm so sorry :(

@readbtwnthelyme @MrsKrazyMonkey It is! :(

But relief from worrying about where I'll lay my head down next. Relief from bouncing around from place to place. Been in limbo for awhile.
Well, some good things have happened today. I haven't felt this kind of relief in months. And no, not a relief from my feelings.
Fuck everything. Just want to go back to bed and sleep....
Ugh I need a drink like right now...

Good night guys
I'm so drained.
@FirstStepcom @WesA1966 Yes! Absolutely!
You all get it when no one else does.
But on Twitter, I have a whole community of people who are so amazing and wonderful.
They don't understand me
I don't understand people
@Christi_Girl14 Yes. We do.
@hellobipolar Mine too
@Christi_Girl14 Love you too!!
I just wanna be validated
Why is it the ones closest to you who fail to understand how mental illness works?
Today it's the opposite. Then I was told, "Well you can't be suicidal ALL the time."
I went to the ER because I was stressed. And anxious.
"Your chest pain. What was that about? And now you're suicidal again. I don't get it."
Told my dad and step mom I was feeling suicidal today and they're like, "Well you went to the ER last night because you were concerned about

Dying inside..
@Bobby_Steps Almost 4 months
@24bearcoughlan I can't buy alcohol or drugs anyway. Not where I'm staying, I'd get kicked out
For fuck's sake, let me feel.
Omg not everything needs a damn explanation or a reason. Can't I just feel?
I wanna drink and use so bad
I hate myself.
@WarriorOfDemiXx DM Me?
@marylougeorge2 @depressionnote Thank you
@WarriorOfDemiXx Im here for you.
@WarriorOfDemiXx Deserved what? :((
Just had a long binge of food. Anything to numb me...
@surelybutslowly Ha! I figured from your post
@Simone_Biles This needs to happen asap.
@WesA1966 Thank you! I needed this today
@surelybutslowly I've never even heard that song??? Heard about it, but not heard it.
@sheisdying_ Omg! That's scary are you ok??
Quite the contrary
I seek medical help for something and I get a fucking lecture about it. I don't go running to the ER for everything.
I hate my life. Seems like everything I'm doing is wrong. Coping skills, if I hear those words one more time.
I woke up feeling like shit already.
Got a big ole lecture from my dad this morning. Just what I needed.
@Christi_Girl14 Same, well, I have to learn
@IICrsii49 @depressionnote That too
I've always wanted to play an instrument...piano? Guitar?
@Fehertwit Oh my gosh. I'm so so sorry
@depressionnote Hopefully asleep and not in pain
Food always kills the pain, well, for a short time. Then it comes back... #mhchat #bingeeatingdisorder

@knuf1985 Well, I spoke to him last night and he said he had gone to psychiatric emergency services because he was feeling that way
Good night twitter
@Christi_Girl14 Thank you
@Christi_Girl14 Heaviness
I cannot lose him...
Now I'm worried about another close friend of mine. His best friend just died a few days ago by suicide. Now he himself is suicidal.
"But I just saw her last week." #SurvivorsRemorse
Upon returning, news of her passing traveled.
I remember being 11 years old and hugging Gabrielle goodbye on the last day of school before spring break.
I had no idea that was the last time I'd see him.
I know what happened to them is not my fault. But how could I not see that Tonia was struggling? And I saw Colin two months before he died.
#SurvivorsRemorse is the worst. I have it now that Tonia's passed away. I had it when Colin and Gabrielle passed away.
"I can't even handle me at my worst." - falling apart #KeepTalkingMH #writing
"It's not your fault." - it never was #writing #KeepTalkingMH
They'd take pieces of me with them, others chunks of my heart.
I don't know what I would do if I lost my best friends right now.
I wish I was manic. #KeepTalkingMH #bipolartype2 #butdoireallywannabe
I hate this... #KeepTalkingMH #lonely #bipolartype2

@bdp_girl Me too
@I_AmStruggling Wish I was
I'm so tired....
@TheKatemiya I will. I'll find someone to go to
She told me it was nothing to worry about because "I'm too young."
I really need to get a second opinion on my swollen ankles and feet. Been going on for probably over a week. Saw my GP for it.

@Christi_Girl14 I know the feeling :/
I'm not even humiliated anymore. I've been fat since 4th grade what does it matter now?
@Christi_Girl14 @depressionnote Right!?
@Christi_Girl14 Not really. I feel detached from myself
Binge eating because I can. It's once again taking the place of my addiction. I've never been as high as 282 lbs, but barriers can be broken
I hate being told what to do
@accordingtokenz How are you doing??
"Might as well light up another cigarette, apply some lipstick, and go on about my business." - crushed dreams, open seams
"It wasn't supposed to be like this." - cliche but true
Wtf I wasn't even quoting that!?
In the mean time, I'll just express myself in creative ways....and why not?"
I really should go to bed because I'm tired.
But I've stayed sober all this time. By the grace of something
On top of it, I wanna get loaded so so bad.
I'm really trying to have faith that I will. But I'm just not sure.
The first time I tried recovering, I wrote in my journal that if I ever relapsed, I might never come back from it.
Eating disorder is winning every round
282 pounds and getting higher..
I just don't care anymore...
I don't know what's worse, that I buy that stuff or that I just couldn't give two shits about myself or how much higher my weight will go.
Sometimes two things of ice cream because When will I get to the store again.
I know I get stares and looks when people see my shopping cart at Lucky or Food Maxx and it's full of cookies, donuts, Capri Sun, ice cream.
Stuff the pain down all you like, but do it for too long and you'll end up like me. I wish I was in a better frame of mind to stop binging.
Between struggling with eating disorders and being an alcoholic and an addict, I just don't know how to process feelings.
Clearly I'm all over the place tonight. My emotions are powerful and i have trouble keeping them at bay.
She brightened up others days when she couldn't brighten her own. Rest in paradise, Tonia Lynn.
I hope that she found the peace she was looking for and doesn't hurt anymore. But it still hurts me. I could go to her for anything
Closest friends. Dammit I wish I could have messaged her on Facebook. And her birthday is in 2 days.
It's important to talk about #suicide and #mentalhealth. I have lost 2 people I know to suicide, with the second person being one of my

It adds up to every single time people have pushed me away including my mother.
Goddammit I tried to HELP you. I tried to be there for you. You pushed me away.

Migraine. Fibro flare. Depression. Suicidal thoughts. Ptsd flashbacks. Nausea. When will this stop. #PTSD #KeepTalkingMH #spoonie
All those tests and dialation of my pupils and all those bright lights made my migraine worse
And today I spent three hours at the retinologist just to be told there were just calcium deposits in my optic nerves. Totally harmless.
Oh and on top of that I have a horrible migraine and nausea. If it lasts till tomorrow I might have to get a Toradol shot
I miss you so much.
My heart is breaking.
@GleeWarriorx And may I ask what the day count is for?
@GleeWarriorx Ohh yeah. I can see how that can happen. That happened to me on Wellbutrin
@TheSt1ck Thanks!
@udisglutenfree I just had to go gluten free because I'm pretty sure I have a wheat allergy but you guys rock!
@IICrsii49 Yeah. I suppose
@GleeWarriorx Yeah. I resonate with you on that :(
I feel so dizzy and nauseous. #Vertigo #ibs #ThisIsWhatAnxietyFeelsLike
There is no greater pain than mourning the loss of someone still alive. I hate this fucking disease. #Addiction #ithurts #imissyou
Just had @udisglutenfree chocolate muffins and was NOT disappointed! Love your products so far
Damn I need a cigarette
Damn I need a cigarette
Dammit I'm fucking up my life
@GleeWarriorx I'm so sorry :( how are you now?
I'm going to miss my brother
@GleeWarriorx I know what you mean. Is it like a knife in the stomach feeling? Or an impending sense of doom? Or just free floating?
Well, shopping spree, brunch with the family, and now yogurt time
@GleeWarriorx I'm sorry. Me too babe :(
I hope I don't bring my family down with me when we go out to eat
Feeling oh so low
@EndTheStigma_ie Thank you so much
@IICrsii49 Thank you very much
@Christi_Renee14 I love you too!
I hate myself
I want my smile back. #depression #bipolar #schizoaffective #PTSD #KeeptalkingMH https://t.co/o4wkNl7l89
And I lapsed with smoking
I'm hurting
@amylawability Ok thanks
@xBr0kenWingsx Happens to me too
@VanRyan Thank you
But no tears are coming.
I honestly feel like crying
@knuf1985 Thank you
I'm dissociating so bad right now. I feel so out of it. #KeepTalkingMH
#YouMightHaveDepressionIf you lose interest in pretty much everything
#Iwantyoutoknow that ptsd is real
#Iwantyoutoknow that today is just too hard.
Having #ADHD is not my fault
#YouMightHaveDepressionIf it takes all the energy in the world just to stare at the wall.
I just want to sleep all day. Nothing interests me. I have no joy for anything. #YouMightHaveDepressionIf #KeepTalkingMH
Isolating myself is my only way through this. I can't cope. #YouMightHaveDepressionIf #KeepTalkingMH
Feeling drowned out #KeepTalkingMH
@BekaLombardo Love you!!
Sorry for being inactive on here today...I'm just drained
@Ihatethisugh1 Yeah, true.
@Ihatethisugh1 Thank you so much
So sad tonight. Good night all. Climbing into bed. Love you guys.
But I had to take my meds
Water makes me sick I swear. I would rather live on ginger ale
Ugh I feel so sick right now
And I just wanna lie down
It's too crowded in this car
Wtf now I have to go on a car ride? Wtf
There's no feeling like feeling alone in a house full of people and you feel like you can't approach people.
Uuuuuugh I feel so sick
Finally home
Prescriptions for hydroxyzine and Imitrex were sent.
Have an appointment with my primary care doc on the 24th of July.
Doctor thinks it's medication interactions. Gave me a shot of Toradol in the arm. Was told to get off Zofran because of my prolonged QT :((
At doctors
Thank god I'm going to the doctor today. Hopefully I'll get some answers
@knuf1985 Aww. You're the best. You're always there
@MBrynSchut Thank you friend.
@BekaLombardo Thank you so much @BekaLombardo
I just wanna take my medications and go to bed
I'm in so much pain and all I wanna do is lie down
@Ihatethisugh1 Thank you so much
Everyone here is ignoring me
I wanna go back home I don't wanna be here
Im feeling so alone
@Sarcasticack Thank you
@Christi_Renee14 Thank you!
@Sarcasticack Me too
Same with my shoulder blades
Took an Imitrex for my migraine this morning but my head still hurts. My entire spine feels like it's on fire
Woke up from my nap just to go to the bathroom :( I seriously feel nauseous right now and I can't take another Zofran for 4 hrs
@bdp_girl Thanks sweetie
@weallneedhelp4 Thank you!
Please Zofran kick in
Looks like ginger ale and toast for breakfast. Can't even stomach coffee :( I hate migraines and nausea
@falidude @BekaLombardo Thank you
I just want my Imitrex and my Zofran. Then I probably won't feel so shitty. It'll help part of my feeling crappiness.
Please pray for me. I'm having so many nightmares  #keeptalkingMH #PTSDAwarenessMonth
@LiveSober80 Thanks dear! Xx
Sorry for pouring my heart out on here, guys but I needed to get stuff out. I hope you understand
#addiction is something I didn't choose or want. But recovery is something I DID choose. 6 months off painkillers and 69 days off booze.
#disabilities don't make us weird or odd. We just want to be treated like everyone else.
#Iwantyoutoknow that I live with #learningdisabilities
#Iwantyoutoknow that we gotta #KeepTalkingMH. It's important @BekaLombardo
#Autism Is something I live with. It's not my identity
To break the cycle of self hate. I want to see myself the way others see me. Just for once.
#Iwantyoutoknow that I have low self esteem. "But a lot of people do!" Says everyone. I don't need to hear that right now. I'm trying
#Iwantyoutoknow that I'm trying. That I'm learning how to do life again. That being open outside of a therapist room can be hard for me.
I also have #OCD and no it's not just about keeping my room clean. It's about invasive obsessions and compulsions that ruin/run your life
I have a recent #PTSD diagnosis as well. I have a lot of trauma to work through. I was abused a lot and grew up w/ a hoarder parent.
Just because I have #Schizophrenia and #bipolardisorder combined does not make me scary, weird, "out there", or strange. #KeepTalkingMH
The worst thing someone has ever said to me, "your bipolar diagnosis has made you crazier." #bipolardisorder #KeepTalkingMH #breakthestigma
I need/want my Zofran asap #spoonielife #IBS #vertigo
So nauseous
@BeyondBrokenDep @GleeWarriorx Truth :(
Hi, my name is Simone and I'm an #NICU survivor. I was born blue and weighed 2 pounds, 4 ounces at birth. The surfactant drug saved my life
Hi, my name is Simone and I grew up with a hoarder parent. #nomoreshame
If you're afraid to come forward, that's also ok. But please know that your parent(s) living conditions are/were NOT your fault.
RT or like if you were the child of a hoarder parent. This is not to embarrass you, but just to show that you're not alone.
@xzykuda I'm so sorry
Had nightmares last night :(
@xBr0kenWingsx
Owie my cough hurts :(
@jmmaximus13 Oh really? Thank you for the info!
@xBr0kenWingsx You're beautiful
@xBr0kenWingsx I know how you feel. I have a history of eating disorders and hate being weighed, hate scales, etc. scales are for fish.
Out of the hospital! Yay! #spoonie #chroniclife #Healing
I'm soooooo sleepy
And on top of that my asthma and this cough are acting up
Thank god for Imitrex! #Spoonie #migraineawarenessmonth #chronicpain #toomanyervisits
@BekaLombardo Love you
@xBr0kenWingsx I know how you feel! Ugh I hate weigh ins
@BekaLombardo Thank you sweetheart  you holding up ok? I know you're grieving right now
And I'm running out of ginger ale
This cough is driving me nuts and I think I'm losing my voice
And I can't go to sleep
Still in pain; Toradol either doesn't work or wore off. Zofran wore off. I feel so ill.
I'm miserable
At urgent care. Toradol shot right in the ass and some Zofran. Ahhh relief. #spoonie #migrainesufferers #chronicpain
@GleeWarriorx Me too. :D
@GleeWarriorx It was sad. But he and I are as close as we've ever been. Making up for lost time
@GleeWarriorx Yeah. But when I was going through my alcoholism, he and I had a very strained relationship
@GleeWarriorx I love my dad too. He and I are very close
And my heart is fluttering but it corrected itself. And I have no Zofran. This sucks.
@Blu_eyed_gemini Me too :(
@GleeWarriorx So true!
I'm nauseous. I'm wobbly and unsteady on my feet. I'm light headed. And I'm catching the same cough my housemate has.
Feeling like crud today. Fibro is flaring from my toes to my scalp so everything burns. I have a headache so it hurts to move my eyeballs.
@accordingtokenz I'll ask my doctor about those! Because I'm suffering so bad
I hate IBS. I hate vertigo. Second time falling out of bed this week
@accordingtokenz Like I ate dinner and I was fine and now I'm super sick. My friend is bringing me ginger ale. I do https://t.co/TPMTTjwKsA
Nauseous again :'(
Zofran is the best.  #Spoonie #IBS #nausea #mystomachisrippingapart
@Nottherealwavy Ok
Just had a PB and banana sandwich on cinnamon raisin bread and now my stomach is killing me :((((
Thank god it's Saturday and The pharmacy at my doctors office isn't too crowded
I need to pee but the bathroom is all the way down the hall. Fuck. Too dizzy to get up. #vertigo #spoonie
And on top of that, my Zofran didnt get filled and hopefully I can go today if my Lyft driver lets me.
Finally passed a BM after four or five days. I hate IBS. And my stomach is flaring so bad. I'm in a lot of pain.
@GleeWarriorx I agree with Cody! I might have ptsd and feel like my trauma was nothing. But we can't compare. We still need to heal.
@xBr0kenWingsx I'm sorry honey
These doctors here in the ER can be so crass
Looking forward to my PCP appointment tomorrow morning
Why do I have to get a doctor who's so rude?
So nauseous:(
@knuf1985 Thanks. I feel so sick
In ER again
@MoaningMama Of course. Always here for you. Not doing well. In the emergency room with heart issues :/
@GleeWarriorx Talking about your mental illness is NOTHING to be sorry about.
One way to annoy everyone on the unit; keep playing whip my hair
I mean seriously his attitude
Dear ER doctor, sorry you're having a bad day but don't take it out on me.
Thanks for that
Man I'm stupid
@BekaLombardo Thank you.
@Christi_Renee14 Message me
@Christi_Renee14 I'm sorry :(
@susi2010 Thank you very, very much.
@VanRyan Thank you for reassuring me this.
@Christi_Renee14 I love you too!
@PotataHed  thank you
@PotataHed Thank you so, so much
@IICrsii49 That's great! I'm glad to hear that
@WesA1966 Truth!
And on top of it, fibromyalgia is kicking my ass. #spoonielife #chronicpain #fibroflare
I can't bear the sadness, the paranoia, the suicidal thoughts, the dissociation, the panic attacks, and losing hope. #KeepTalkingMH
I hate everything that comes with #mentalillness.
My mind plays tricks on me and tells me evil things. #KeepTalkingMH
I live in fear every day because of my GAD, panic disorder, OCD, paranoia, and possible PTSD. #KeepTalkingMH
Bipolar and schizoaffective have taken everything from me. #KeepTalkingMH
I used to be somebody.
God what is happening to me.....I used to be such a charming, compassionate, witty, sassy, happy person.
@Christi_Renee14 I don't like who I am now either. And I'm sorry you feel like you have to do that :(
Oh how times have changed
I'm turning into a grouchy old woman. When I was younger and working in the kitchen, I used to blare Slayer at 6 am.
I think 8 am is a little early to blast all this music.
@susi2010 Oh, I'm not suicidal right now don't worry! :) I was just writing it down because whenever I have said it https://t.co/frfoj44Dq1
@susi2010 Thank you
Losing interest in things you used to love is totally real. #depressionawareness #KeepTalkingMH
When I say I'm suicidal, take me seriously. #KeepTalkingMH
The loneliness gets unbearable at times. #KeepTalkingMH
@MoaningMama I'll talk to you xx
Sheets changed. Bed made. Only one in the house up besides night shift staff
And no it wasn't poop. Maybe I'll change my sheets. Just what I feel like doing at 5 am
Woke up, had to put a fresh depends on, fresh pajamas, and put a towel on my sheets because I had an accident. Now I can't go back to bed.
Good night guys
@knuf1985 Thank you!!
@Christi_Renee14 Yes. Quetiapine is the generic
@GleeWarriorx Glad you're here!
@soupernic Praying!
Took my Seroquel PRN for my anxiety. Seriously, it needs to kick in. Soon.
@PotataHed Thank you
@knuf1985 Thank you. Cause right now the days gone sour and I'm depressed now :(
What if it goes away???
I hope this feeling okay isn't just a fluke. That having a good day for once isn't just a one off. #lifewithmentalillness
My anxiety is kind of high right now
@knuf1985 A woot woot
No hallucinations today!
Tears. Crying. Suicidal thoughts. #depression

Psychiatrist appointment today.......
@xBr0kenWingsx I'm sorry love :(
Really frustrating session with my therapist
@surelybutslowly Thank you. I'm trying :/
My psychiatrist appointment is tomorrow so if I can stay out of the hospital.....
Didn't take long for the suicidal thoughts to start
In the waiting room of my therapists office
My turn to cook dinner tonight
Lasagna is in the oven
The suicidal thoughts and auditory hallucinations are back
@28DaysMore Just being in an environment I'm not familiar with
Well this is awkward
Sleepy time awaits

Good night guys, love you all!
Meds in half an hour then snooze time
Blow up the outside world....
@janayafe Thank you.
@SherriR11 I'll try.
Now I'm depressed, tearful, suicidal, anxious, and hurting
Mood plummeted so fast. I was fine two hours ago
Half an hour till check in group
Pumpkin coffee by Maxwell House is life
Why? Why does this happen to me every time?
@Christi_Renee14 @BekaLombardo Me too. I have to hold onto hope for doctors nurses and hospitals to take me seriously
Last time I had it it was in both feet and I could barely walk
I'm getting that awful foot pain again, but just in one foot. It hurts SO bad. Thanks #fibro
@Christi_Renee14 @BekaLombardo And @BekaLombardo
@Christi_Renee14 @BekaLombardo Trying my best! Love you too @Christi_Renee14
@CocoSurviving @itsanidealworld Mine too, when all else fails
Sitting here feeling like shit
Being discharged from the hospital
Now the voices telling me to hurt myself are returning and I'm in the hospital waiting for a room
Having some visual hallucinations as well
Oh, depression now too. Great. Awesome.
Anxiety.
Alright, new day. Let's see if it's better than yesterday
@xBr0kenWingsx Likewise! I'm here for you too xx
@karanirvana I needed this-- thank you!
@CocoSurviving @BekaLombardo Thank you so much!
@BekaLombardo Thank you.  I'm a little anxious today, but not feeling depressed right now thank god. That could change any minute though.
Good night everyone
Had a good chat. I'm just gonna keep pushing on
Finally answered her phone!
@IICrsii49 Never mind she answered her phone. But thanks for checking in!
What to do?????
Tried calling my therapist on her cell phone twice. No answer and I'm having a crisis
@Christi_Renee14 I'm so sorry. You can always talk to me!
@Christi_Renee14 Oh honey :( *hugs*
I'm trying my hardest to use coping skills but they aren't working. #KeepTalkingMH
Visual hallucinations and hearing voices. Mood swings. I can't deal. #KeepTalkingMH
Dammit. I hate this
@xBr0kenWingsx I totally get it. I know your feelings all too well. :(
@Christi_Renee14 Whaaat. That's not cool :(
@Christi_Renee14 I'm so sorry it didn't help :(
@xBr0kenWingsx It is awful :( I'm questioning everything too
@Christi_Renee14 Sorry :( hugs? I'm sorry you're fighting this too. I hate depression
One day, I'll look at the hospital signs on the freeway and not fight the urge to pull over and go there. #KeepTalkingMH
@xBr0kenWingsx I'm feeling same :(
Feeling really upset right now
And on top of it, I'm getting triggered by the sight of alcohol, which means cravings. And getting triggered by the sight of binge food
I've reached my threshold of how much I can handle
Getting grocery store anxiety
Yay an outing?? Yes please! Somewhere besides the ER
When in doubt, earphones in. World out.
The Kinetics- DJ Krush
One Step Closer- Linkin Park
Just when I was having such a good day, my suicidal thoughts come back
@Amy72014 Good!! I'm so glad
@SemicolonTravel Thank you! I'll definitely take you up on that
And getting put on Zoloft. I hope this helps
Well, ended up back in the hospital and now I'm out. But, finally a med change!! Bye bye Prozac.
Clearly I'm having a bad day.....
Fuck you, hallucinations. Just fuck you.
A shower is absolutely out of the question. #SpoonieProblems #Fibromyalgia #nervepain

I hate dissociating. #PTSDchat
I am the most impatient person sometimes
Come on dad and step mom, hurry up and get hereeee
@hdbigjourney I will
This is a crisis. This is an emergency. I need help.
13 hospitalizations and 3 ER visits for suicidal thoughts. Hopefully tomorrow I see the psychiatrist that my step mom knows
No more.
But today, my goal is to stay out of the damn hospital
Im sick of going to Santa Rosa memorial hospital just to get discharged. No one would take me to Marin General.
Hopefully today is a better day
My meds make me tired
So fucking tired this morning. I can't stop yawning.
Off to bed. Good night, all.
@GleeWarriorx Sending lots of love your way
Nice to Know You- Incubus
@GleeWarriorx I'm so sorry :(
Still not tired
@susanroeder Thank you
@soberboots Exactly Damien. Thank you for saying this.
@xzykuda Thank you! :)
I used to be able to be so social
Great. After only 2 hours, I have to leave my friends party :(
@magical_tears @ddlovato Thank you!
@knuf1985 Thank you
@xzykuda Nice!
Been feeling depressed, suicidal, and awful all day and music is the only thing that seems to have helped
Sometimes, music really does help.
@ddlovato And we both have bipolar. I also have anxiety and schizoaffective disorder. Thanks for letting me share.
@ddlovato Eating disorders and addiction. I'm almost two months clean and sober. June 10th will be 2 months
@ddlovato I also just wanted to say thank you for your bravery in sharing your story. I too struggle with mental illness and have battled
Cool for the summer- Demi Lovato @ddlovato blasting this song to make me feel better
Spiderwebs- No Doubt
That's All- Genesis
Yay my NA sponsor called me back!  we had a good talk
@PotataHed Thank you! So much!
But my sponsors aren't picking up their phones  and I really need to talk to them
But I'm getting some good tips from some of my sober sisters about what to do at the party if there's alcohol
Now I'm having alcohol and drug cravings hella bad
Like anything that will pull me out of this. I hope my friends graduation party does
Could also go for one of these right now :( https://t.co/Njjdzgd81a
God dammit I hate feeling this sad
@GleeWarriorx Yeah. :/ I'm sure other people feel the same
Sad :(
@GleeWarriorx I have no plans, just thoughts. And I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. :(
@GleeWarriorx I live in a social rehab/group home so it's hard to get away from this person unfortunately. :/
Sometimes I still feel lost but a little less lost
Man, if it weren't for the staff at my social rehab I would be so lost :(
Flower- Moby
@GleeWarriorx I don't want to go to the hospital again :(
@GleeWarriorx I'm just a very sensitive person. That and I've been suicidal for weeks and months. This didn't help.
@GleeWarriorx It all started when someone in group talked about how he would kill himself in detail and I got trigg https://t.co/q3zSZSOLz8
@GleeWarriorx Sure. Just having a tough night.
@paul_JFT Thanks for being so encouraging
@paul_JFT Thank you
@paul_JFT Thank you
@paul_JFT @BeyondBrokenDep Exactly!
There are details I don't need to know
Ummmm, triggering as hell. Channel changed.
@GleeWarriorx Aw I'm sorry :( I hate being lonely. Right now, I'm feeling sad, triggered (suicidal), and anxious. :/
@GleeWarriorx Hi! :) how are you?
@GleeWarriorx I do!
I can't concentrate worth a damn today
I haven't had many hallucinations today, but when I have had them, they've been auditory
I get triggered very easily
I'm just a super sensitive person
Feeling super triggered right now
Somebody Else by The 1975 is one of my favorite songs ever.
We Are Rockstars- Does It Offend You, Yeah?
Dammit now I'm (possibly) getting hypomanic
Is it bed time yet?
@25Years1Lesson Thank you
@pixelsoulz :( I'm sorry. That's been me in the past. I haven't binged in like a week or two.
Using my coping skills as much as I can
Now I'm hyper and craving alcohol and drugs. Arrrrrrrgh
Out of the hospital!
I don't go to the hospital or PES for nothing. I just want someone to see how much I'm hurting. #KEEPTALKINGMH
To me that night. And PES keeps kicking me out because they think I just want to get away for the weekend. I actually need help.
The hospital that I kept going to for observation eventually turned me away because I "came there too much." The psych liaison was horrible
Quiet."
I don't trust cops anymore :( I've had a few police escorts to the hospital and the last time they just told me to "knock it off and be
Just because I have bipolar does not mean I'm crazy. #KEEPTALKINGMH
Good night everyone  it's been a very draining day
@Amy72014 @paul_JFT @susanroeder Thank you, sweetie
@paul_JFT @susanroeder  thank you
@susanroeder @paul_JFT Thank you
@paul_JFT @susanroeder Thank you so much
I don't know what's scarier about my schizoaffective disorder..the paranoia or the hallucinations? #KeepTalkingMH
Getting put on a 5150 is scary as fuck. I've been hospitalized 12 times since December 28, 2015. #KeepTalkingMH #mentalhealthmonth
It really depends on the hospital. Some guards are nice, others are drill sergeants. #mentalhealthmonth #KeepTalkingMH
@IIJennaWhiteII
Dear security guards at hospitals, don't all of a sudden treat me like im crazy or be mean because I'm on a 5150. #KeepTalkingMH
Dear medical staff at hospitals, When I tell you I'm suicidal, please take me seriously. Sincerely, me #KeepTalkingMH
That and "Well, there must be a trigger for this." Not everything needs a damn explanation or reason behind it!!! #KeepTalkingMH
Grrrr! I absolutely detest being asked "Did you take your meds?" When I tell someone I'm sad. Argh! #keeptalkingmh
@WesA1966 :'(
I'm suicidal still. My body hurts. My depression sucks. My paranoia is high.
Feeling so crappy today. I hate the way my current meds make me feel; sedated, tired, spaced out, ugh
@BekaLombardo I love you.
@The_Autism_Dad Crappy. And sad. Suicidal.
Thank you all for the support.  I love you guys so!
@heyheylaw Thank you! I hope so too!
@paul_JFT @susanroeder Oh I am. I'm hanging in there
@susanroeder No psychiatric hospital beds were open.
@susanroeder I should be in patient, but no one in the medical facility is taking me seriously.  I went to the hos https://t.co/eIA5JDuFzE
@Nottherealwavy Truth. :(
Yep, still feeling suicidal and awful
And on top of that, my fibromyalgia is flaring like crazy
@JaimiePhD Seriously!!
I feel so stigmatized
PES wouldn't even take me
This would never have happened to me in Los Angeles county
I want to file a grievance against that hospital so bad
A real psychiatrist would never tell a suicidal person to use their coping skills wham bam thank you ma'am
They just turned me away, told me I came there too much, and use my coping skills. A real hospital would never turn somebody away.
They didn't even admit me to the hospital last night for my suicidal ideation.
This is getting very frustrating, this fight.
@susanroeder Something has to change. They wouldn't even admit me to the hospital last night
@susanroeder I like that :)
@TheSt1ck Thank you so much.
I don't know how much fight I have left. This is getting very frustrating
Waking up with these thoughts yet again
@LiveSober80 Thank you very much sweetie. Xx
Do I honestly need to wear a sign that says I need help around my neck?? Good god
Why does this shit keep happening to me? Wtf.
I have therapy today too so that should be good
On another note, i hope my case worker has been called
Now there's milk everywhere
Biggest pet peeve: when people don't empty their cereal bowls into the sink FIRST before putting them in the dishwasher.
I'm trying to use my coping skills for now, but I just know I really need help
I know I really need help
@pixelsoulz Good! Yay!
@bdp_girl *gentle hugs back*
Grilled cheese and tomato soup is always a good combo
All they do for me is send me to CSU and they don't help you there either
Never seeking a hospital's help again unless I absolutely have to
So glad to be back at E Street.
@bdp_girl Me too :(
I can hear one of my housemates singing/rapping in the shower. It's really hilarious
So ready for bed tonight
Back at my group home/social rehab
Outta the hospital!!!
I seriously have had the best nurses here at the hospital
Val and Rene #nurseheroes #NursesWeek2017
And since my hold got lifted, I can watch tv
Then I get to go back to my group home/social rehab and be with my housemates and staff
Spoke to someone here at the hospital already. I'm busting the hell outta here soon! Thank god! My hold got lifted.
@hdbigjourney Just spoke to psychiatrist here at the hospital not too long ago. I'm busting the fuck outta this joint soon
And I could really use someone to talk to
Wishing someone would bring me a Starbucks right now
@ASeaofBlues Thank you very much
@hopein12steps Thanks Kevin!
@susanroeder Thank you
@soberboots Thank you, Damien.
@TedPerkins10 Thank you
@kezm33 Thank you
Can't somebody for once tell me it's okay for me to be sad? Distressed? And to have these thoughts?
I'm sick of everyone telling me to be strong
I could go for 1), a Starbucks frappucino. 2), cake. 3), chocolate chip cookies. 4), a donut
Eeeeeek everyone around me is getting a cold  help meeeee
@mechanical_meat Thank you very much.
It's been a rough week.
@xzykuda Oh, I'm being careful! Not making any major life changes right now
I've felt like this since yesterday. I'm laughing a lot and I just seem very "up". I woke up at 6 am and wasn't tired
Feeling inflated, having flighty ideas, wanting to talk a lot, etc
Well guys, it feels like I'm heading into a hypo manic episode. I'm having racing thoughts, feeling like I could shoot through the roof,
@WonderlandBlogs Hugs back. I have fibromyalgia so I understand
@WonderlandBlogs Truth :(
@BekaLombardo I'm so sorry for your loss
Good morning everyone
Boy am I exhausted. Time for bed.
@MoaningMama Thank you!  so far I'm doing okay
@knuf1985 Thank you.
Ended up spending the night in the hospital, but got released today
Hi guys, I'm back!
@pixelsoulz Thanks hun.  I appreciate that :)
Like wtf. Why would you say that
When you tell someone how you're really doing and how you're having thoughts of hurting yourself and they go, "why would you want to do that
@recovery_chic I use the Serenity Prayer too. I've been doing a lot of praying lately
@TheSt1ck @recovery_chic Thank you
Proving to be another difficult day
@recovery_chic So far it's looking like another difficult day
@recovery_chic I sure hope so
Thanks for the support everyone. Good night. Xx
I hate when your mind turns against you
Still feeling awful though. And experiencing SI
Good talk with AA sponsor
@paul_JFT I hope this passes. I'm not sick. Just feeling sad and shit. :(
Feeling absolutely awful
Crashing hard...
@Uberdead Thanks, I'll try that!
Great. One of my housemates sounds sick. I do not want to get sick again. Please god.
Good night. Xx
@pixelsoulz Thank you. So far not great, but hopefully I'll do a bit better every day. Xx
And that tomorrow will be a better day
Hopefully this will pass
I feel so bad right now
Ugh
Is it bed time yet?
@MoaningMama @TheSt1ck Thank you!
@TheSt1ck Trying.
Feeling crappy today
@jhorton562 Thank you
@Tracey79189584 Thank you!
Slowly getting settled into my group home here...
Whoa sorry guys for leaving you hanging!
@PotataHed Yeah, im able to take it easy tonight. Try to do things that make me happy
Today has been pretty rough
The sky was lighting up a bit. Taken at 5:30 am https://t.co/lAeZyv9hF3
Waiting at the bus stop for my early morning meeting in Sonoma
But I seriously hate this heat. I'd rather get rained on
My battery is at 57% already? Good god
Still waiting to see the psychologist at the regional center
A frappucino never fails in hot weather.  #starbucks #summerweather #sonomacountyliving https://t.co/8wIzPIgfne
It's not summer yet calm down weather
It's too hot!!!
@susanroeder Hell yeah! That would be awesome!
My eating disorder makes things a lot more complicated
One day, I'm not going to struggle so much with simple things
Looking forward to meeting new psychiatrist. I have so much to talk about with him...
Gonna be a busy, busy day today!
@susanroeder Yes!! Let's do it!
@susanroeder Really!? Awesome!!
Good meeting with AA sponsor just now!
@IICrsii49 You're welcome! :)
@susanroeder Yes!!
@IICrsii49 You're so welcome! Xx
@TheSarahFader I hate bipolar crashes too. They're awful :(
@knuf1985 @lauracloughley Don't grow up it's a trap
90 degrees in Santa Rosa= perfect day for sitting inside Starbucks and drinking a frappucino. Waiting for my AA sponsor to get here :)
90 degrees in Santa Rosa= perfect day for sitting inside Starbucks and drinking a frappucino. Waiting for my AA sponsor to get here :)
Thank god I see my new psychiatrist tomorrow.
I need some help. I think I have PTSD. #KeepTalkingMH
@Ihatethisugh1 Thank you. I've lived too many years in shame.
Talking about your mental health is not attention seeking. #KeepTalkingMH
I know Asperger's is hard because there's no medication or treatment for it, but I still thought I should include it.
I am not ashamed to say I have Asperger's, depression, anxiety, bipolar II disorder, and schizoaffective disorder. #KeepTalkingMH
Happy May everyone!

Needless to say, I didn't go to that meeting. I'm home now
Somebody Else- The 1975
Whether or not to go to this meeting at 9:30, I don't know.....
@The_Autism_Dad Not well.
So here I am at Boudin eating a breakfast sandwich and figuring out my next move
Woke up early just to get to my Sonoma meeting just to miss the bus, tried going to another meeting but the location was too far.
@nothings4eva Thank you so much, dear. I will. Xx
@susi2010 Thank you!
My mood just plummeted like 1000%
@nothings4eva I'm not okay, but im hanging in there
@25Years1Lesson @ASeaofBlues Thank you both!!
@knuf1985 @TheSarahFader Yeah :( I'm sorry you're going through that.
Me too. https://t.co/NFnVIKVe0A
No motivation whatsover.
I really want to write a blog post, but what about? :((
I want it to be fall again. :(
And I'm congested again. How long will this last????? D:
@knuf1985 @TheSarahFader Huh. I wonder why it affected me so badly.
@TheSarahFader Seriously!!! I used to take it and it fucked me up hella bad
@fiftyminus2 Beautiful girls! Xx
Still feeling super sad today
Well hopefully tomorrow is a better day
@manisha_gopal Thank you
My dad just came but still it was nice
I love how caring the AA community is. I was seen waiting outside for my dad to come and had two people ask if I needed a ride home.
Trying to fight really hard today. Planning on going to a meeting at 2:00
Dammit and I lost my meeting schedules too. What the fuck.
The next bus doesn't come until 1:52 PM.
Woke up really sad today :( and the bus schedules on the weekends are the pits around here!
Wow, the outpouring of support on here....thanks so much guys.  I love you all so much.
@vixxy_rose Thank you so much.
@mechanical_meat And thank you.
@mechanical_meat Me too!
@AprilRhynold It really does :(
@surelybutslowly It really is,
@SherriR11 Thank you.
@pixelsoulz Thanks so much!  it seems to be better today
@TheSt1ck Thanks, I will.
@mhjourney87 Thank you
Oh my god, this squeaky toy is going to get on my nerves FAST.
I love my dad
Had a complete panic attack at the mall and had to call my dad crying in front of the candy store. Thankfully he calmed me down
Just beating myself up for everything today
@surelybutslowly Thanks so much!
@bookgirlb Thank you.
Drinking some water and trying to calm down. My anxiety has been so bad today
Well, I shall see
I don't like when people get mad at me :(
Like, I didn't want to be cooped up in my house for the next three hours.
Now my sponsor is frustrated with me because I want her to meet me at the mall :(
@accordingtokenz Doctors are stupid
So fucking anxious.
I love my pharmacist at my local CVS. Guiding me when to take my cold medicine is exactly what I need right now.
This nasal congestion is not the business
Man, my feet are killing me. :(
Hopefully this means that this cold is on it's way out!!!
Feeling a bit better physically today :D
Doctor's appointment went well!
I need to stop taking that shit.
Just took my Klonopin and it's making me tired. I know I should go back to bed....
Less than 20 more minutes till my clinic opens up, then I can call them.
Step Momma is de frosting more chicken noodle soup for me :D
@TheSt1ck Thanks I will! Trying
But I have a doctor appointment at 1:40
And I could sleep all day long
Woke up feeling even worse today-- body aches from head to toe, needing to use my inhaler on the hour every hour, congested, ugh.
Eligible for food stamps! Thank god.
Yaaaaay my dad's going out to get chicken noodle soup yaaaaaaay. :D
Made it back home. Sipping on hot water with lemon and reading my literature; about to call my NA sponsor.
Getting bus home soon
But I'm skipping my NA meeting  I just feel too lousy physically
Got a prayer circle goin for me
So glad I went to my OA meeting, even if I was late.
@getbackup089 Congratulations!!!!
Still going to my meetings anyway
And I have a cough. #teamdayquil
I cannot breathe through my nose. Ugh.
Great. Now I'm officially sick.
I'm getting a referral packet but I don't know when the interview is happening
Well, heard back. Halfway there
Just chillin here at the mall Starbucks. Still waiting to hear back.
@TheSt1ck Thank you. xx
Thank you. xx
I'm trying to get into a dual diagnosis rehab program where they treat eating disorder as well as drug abuse. Please pray.
I need all the prayers, good vibes, good energy, everything in the world right now.
Ohhhhhhh my god here comes the anxiety. Shit shit shit.
I am so tired but I've had so much coffee already.
I love starting my day with meetings
@pixelsoulz About to head home from my AA meeting. Just waiting for the bus to get here :)
@pixelsoulz How are you? :)
So good morning everyone!
Got up super early this morning for a 7:30 am AA meeting in Sonoma
@knuf1985 Almost! ;)
But for some reason, I can't get "I'm a little teapot" out of my head.
Went to an awesome young peoples meeting earlier today. I quite liked it.
Got a sponsor for AA too! What is this, my lucky day?
Deleted myfitnesspal. Good riddance.
Just had coffee at 3:55 PM. I don't know if this is a good or a bad idea.
My tea is still too hot to drink :(
But on the bright side, I got a new sponsor for NA and I finally have the NA "big book" the Basic Text
It started this morning and now I've got a scratchy throat and a cough to boot. No fun! :(
And I mean my 12 step literature. Then after my meeting, I'm gonna mosey on over to the Santa Rosa Transit Mall and get the bus home.
Sitting here drinking my coffee. Getting ready for my NA meeting at 10. Gonna try to read some literature before I go. #SundayMorning
Good morning!
Good night guys
@6290jozze Thank you. I needed to hear that. Yes, they certainly are. Hope you're well. xx
I can't wait to go to bed.
@PotataHed I don't know many people in AA yet. :/
And I missed my chance at going to an AA meeting because the bus left already. Fuck fuck fuck. Just when I'm having cravings on top of this.
And so far I have failed epicly at the whole not bingeing compulsive eating thing today. Wtf is wrong with me.
@hdbigjourney It was :)
"Indeed!" I said smiling back. God shot.
She told me to keep hanging in there one day at a time. "It gets better, and it works if you work it." She said with a smile.
How much time do you have?" "8 months." She said. I told her that today I have 12 days. I made it to 5 months and relapsed.
Saw a Whole Foods employee drop her keys and noticed it was full of NA or AA chips. Immediately said, "Don't mean to be nosy, but
@emilyjvanb Thank you!
Yep. That was definitely a job interview going on. I felt nervous for the guy!
Wish I brought a sweater though. I'm kinda cold
Hanging out at Whole Foods till my meeting
@susanroeder Exactly! Very true.
@knuf1985 Triple yay! :D
I miss even one dose and I have psychotic symptoms
Cause sometimes I forget my gabapentin or my risperdal, but I absolutely cannot forget my risperdal.
Took all my meds for this morning and didn't forget a single pill. Yay!
My OA meeting is in an hour.
I'll try at least. I'm human after all.
Alright, new day. I am NOT going to binge or eat compulsively today. Nope, nope, nope. Not today. #determined #recovery
I can hear the robins chirping outside.
Just called my OA sponsor. She is the best!
Watching Good Eats on The Cooking Channel. Just ate my pizza. This is how I'm spending my Friday night.
Boy, am I tired. And it's only 5:39 PM.
Flowers.  #nature https://t.co/XJhk3yWrZI
On the bus now, on my way to Montgomery Village to hang out until I go to my volunteer job
Dammit
Missed my 10:00 bus, guess I'm gonna have to take the 11:25 bus
@RecoveryMum Thank you! xo
Good night all!
@Uberdead Yay indeed!
Looks like I found an AA meeting in lovely Sonoma!
@pixelsoulz It sure sucks. :(
@pixelsoulz @twistedup_Nside Thank you :) I'll try that!
And still the "I want more" comes ... #eatingdisorders #BED
@twistedup_Nside @pixelsoulz Yeah they really are :(
Why is it the day you have to get labs done that you want food and coffee the most? Argh.
Good morning everyone.
@pixelsoulz @twistedup_Nside Yeah, could be! And Latuda made me thirsty also. It was awful.
@twistedup_Nside Could be. :/
Why the fuck am I so thirsty? Yikes!
"The first requirement is that we be convinced that any life run on self-will can hardly be a success." - Big Book, p. 60
@SherriR11 Yes it does :(((
@danielhortonseo Thank you so much. Xx
I can't stand my chronic pain that I know is due to my eating disorder. Everything just hurts so much.
Other than that, I'm looking forward to my AA meeting in Sebastopol
Definitely having some hallucinations today. Feeling like things are crawling on my foot, my scalp. I go to check and nothing is there
@anoddchild Thanks!!
"Blow up the outside world; blow it to hell and gone."
Good night Twitter.
@28DaysMore Argh me too!!! :(
And I'm still on hold.....
My dad and step mom don't keep sweets in the house and if I had my own way, my house would be full of em.
Ate a sweet treat today with my dad. Now I've come home, realized there are no sweets to eat, and now I want to binge. #ihateBED #fuckyouED
And by a call I don't want to make, I mean the Medi-Cal offices.
Conquering my fear of the phone by making a call I really don't want to make. #ThisIsWhatAnxietyFeelsLike
Being on hold can make one the most patient person on earth. #ihatethephone
@surelybutslowly Thank you!
@hdbigjourney I'm not driving! Sitting in the front seat of my dads car. Turned the key in to turn the music on and https://t.co/w2WUh9Ee6C
Oh and by the way I finally got a OA sponsor!!!!
How the fuck did the windshield wipers come on?? Weird.
Just chill the fuck out. I don't read minds
"Alright, who did this?" I didn't know, chill out. I didn't know not to throw away my Starbucks cup in the garbage instead of the recycle.
881 followers!? Thanks you guys!
Off to a morning OA step study meeting
Boy am I exhausted.
@PotataHed Thank you. xoxo
I want fried chicken hella bad!
Oh, and a couple people brought Popeyes chicken on the bus and the bus is filled with the smell of fried chicken. Oh my heart
Some people have the most annoying ass ring/text tones. #publictransit #metrolife
Some people have the most annoying ass ring/text tones. #publictransit #metrolife
7 days clean. I fell back down, but I know I can do this.  #xa #na #twelvesteps #recovery
But looking forward to the OA meeting soon
Mixed feelings
Hanging out in Cotati! My old stomping grounds. Ahh nostalgia
Still waiting on that phone call on where tomorrow's OA meeting is
Waiting for my ice cream to soften up a bit so I can eat it
I'm so cozy under my blankets right now. Don't wanna get out of bed for nothin
I'm so tired
@RichBiscuit21 Thanks, I hope so too!
@RichBiscuit21 Tried reading too, but I can barely concentrate :(
@RichBiscuit21 Trying music right now. Tried writing, may do some more
Trying to use my coping skills, but running out of ideas here...
Depression is kicking my ass today.
Breathe in, breathe out. Caaaaalm down. I hate anxiety.
@PotataHed Me too!!
Not to mention vacuuming is my least favorite chore
I have to vacuum the living room. No motivation to do it. Ugh.
Just made some to do lists and no motivation to do anything on the one I made for today
Want to binge right now..
I love 11th step meditation meetings.
Getting more nervous by the second..
The next week in my planner is looking allllll filled up. Especially Tuesday and Thursday!
I have "Too Good For You" by Drake stuck in my head. I'm singing the lyrics to myself haha
@AmbAdAstra Thanks so much! I hope it's a good fit too :D
Checking out a sober living house at 2 PM today.
New blog post from yesterday! I did insert a trigger warning in it for SH and ED behaviors. https://t.co/yWPnMJxWgx
Ahh, now I'm getting nice and warm.
Okay I'm back. Fuzzy robe is on. And slippers too.
I better go put my fuzzy robe on. Brb.
I really should wash my hair and take a shower today.
Meanwhile, it is absolutely freezing in my house
Sipping on some warm coffee :D
Skipping my OA meeting this morning. I just don't feel like going. I don't know why..
Good night twitter.
@AmbAdAstra Me too :( me too
The aches and pains of my body just make me even more sad
Just started crying. I hate feeling my feelings
Argh cravings and binge eating urges
Had a good session with my therapist. Cried tons
Hi everybody!
@SimbaTalks I'm so sorry :(
@PotataHed Prayers being sent
Took a hot bath. Now off to bed. Good night guys.
I'm getting lots of texts from people, which is nice :)
But I made a hot cup of tea and may take a hot bath. Just trying to use some of my coping skills on my list.
Trying not to beat myself up or feel guilty for binge eating as much as I did.
LOVE this song. https://t.co/nf7U3avfjg
It sure is getting windy out there!
@mymameisrichard Exactly!
Got myself a temporary sponsor!
Aside from the fact that I just burned my tongue on hot coffee.
Watching the rain/drizzle/mist fall outside from where I'm sitting. It's quite peaceful.
@emilyjvanb Thank you so much! &lt;3 I appreciate it!
Hanging out at Boudin.. my fave place
@emilyjvanb Exactly!!
@Uberdead Thank you! Yeah, I was thinking about step study meetings.
Cause right now, I'M my sponsor and trying to work the steps on your own is kind of hard.
And if not today, then hopefully soon. I really, really need one. I can't white knuckle this on my own anymore.
I'm hoping I can get a sponsor soon.
Thank god I'm going to an NA meeting later. These cravings suck.
You know what my coffee would taste even better with? Whiskey. But I'm not going there.
Today I'm going to do my best to honor her memory and remember her
I was 11 years old when she died. She was a year older than me. She was only 12..
There are days it feels like it just happened yesterday. It doesn't make any sense.
It's been sixteen years since my friend Gabrielle passed away.
Today is a somber day for me
Good morning everyone
Took a hot shower. Now off to bed. Good night all.
But the food thing is a different story.
My alcohol and drug cravings are gone finally. :)
It's 9:25 pm. I should be exhausted. I'm not. #toowired
Brewing my hot cup of tea right now.
I was a renewed person.
I miss having someone to work the steps with me because when I was working them, I was a completely different person.
Still have yet to find a sponsor though :( #feelingdiscouraged #NA #OA #twelvesteps
I love all womens meetings
NA meeting was great!
I was home all day and it only drizzled. Now I'm out and an onslaught of rain appears..
@dizzykooks Sometimes I do that too
It's blustery and cold here, supposed to rain tonight!
Off to an NA meeting! Using those coping skills right??
@ourbpfamily Yep. Still makes me uncomfortable :(
Oh boy......cravings are coming.
@AmbAdAstra Thanks! :D
I would do anything for some codeine right now, but that would put me right back at a relapse.
@AmbAdAstra I do too, but someone (me) had to do it. No one was going to do it for me
To this day, I still prefer not to look anyone in the eye even though I "have to".
Eye contact is so intimidating. I didn't look anyone in the eye for the first 12 years of my life. #aspergers #autism
Who Needs Love Like That- Erasure
And I'm still in my pajamas.
Just applied for Cal Fresh online.
Not this next week though.
I have an eye doctor appointment and a Social Security appointment on the same day first week of May. Next week I have the dentist (argh)
Been on the phone pretty much all day with people. First with Sonoma County Human Services, then an eye doctor, then Social Security.
@Uberdead Exactly, thank you!
There's not enough coffee in the world that could wake me up right now. Trying to stay on task.
And the online disability/SSI application still isn't loading. WTF.
Dammit dammit dammit.
Went through my tweets and accidentally retweeted a thing I didn't want to. Too late to delete it now :(
Applying (yet again) for SSI. This should be fun.
@TheBipolarEdge Aw, thank you so much! I really appreciate it
Good night all
@AmbAdAstra Exactly :(((
@Uberdead I hope so
Today has just generally not been a good day
@NotyourNTgirl Thank you so much!
@susanroeder I can try. :/
I could really use a drink right now. On top of that, I want to binge eat.
I can't seem to concentrate worth a damn today.
@NotyourNTgirl Thanks for the follow! xo
@LoopNinetyThree Yeah :( it's rough. I mostly have paranoid thoughts.
I hate that I can't journal around my step mom out of my paranoid fear that she'll look over my shoulder and see it.
@LoopNinetyThree I get paranoid too. Hate it.
Have a dentist appointment next month, not looking forward to it, but gotta do it.
Well, never mind! Just called and I have an "appointment" for 2:15
Called my doctor only to be told I had to wait there all day for no shows and cancellations. The fuck.
Draining day. Time for bed. See you all in the morning
Trying to combat my binge urges with meditation. Seems to work but only for a little while
Man today's been challenging
Mostly calls to make and a meeting at 6 PM. I love 11th Step meditation meetings.
Monday sure is going to be busy!
@LiveSober80 Thank you so much! xx
I'm still obsessing and thinking about food, but at least I'm not having urges right now.
Did a 5 minute meditation cause I felt urges to binge. It took some time, but I don't feel like bingeing anymore.
@LiveSober80 It absolutely is.
Got a book for free and got phone numbers too!
Awesome NA meeting this morning!
Definitely time to say good night, so good night Twitter!
@hellobipolar I know. They really are
Don't mind me, just feeling super sad right now
@Christi_Renee14 Love you too!
Especially when your dad and your step mom have people over and you're trying so hard to act happy for them
@Christi_Renee14 Me too :(
@pixelsoulz Me too
Ugh this is awful
That twinge of sadness you feel when a mood shift happens.
New coping skill added to list.
Cleaning can be quite calming and therapeutic. I am just discovering this.
I can't clean without putting my music on first. #RealTalk #thisishowwedoit
Went on a huge tear cleaning the house! I hope my dad and step mom will be happy when they come home :)
From* argh typos
The Fall Harvest Blend fro TJ's is my favorite.
I love drinking hot tea.
I feel like I've discovered some sort of magic thing! No urges? What is this?
Did a 1 minute meditation as instructed in my new book and I don't feel like bingeing all of a sudden. So meditation really does work???
Problem solved! Battery went kaput.
All my documents are on that computer. Pictures. Everything.
It just straight up shit the bed. The screen went black while I was using it and now it won't start at all. @ASUS can you help me?
Great, now my computer won't start
Had a lovely chat with my brother. Always good to talk to him.
Good thing I went on my walk when I did! Cause it's starting to rain.
My dog tends to go on these barking sprees. I don't know what that's about.
I went for a walk at my step mom's insistence. Ugh. Why is it so hard to do.
I've walked 1,272 steps so far. Okay, it's a start, right? I can barely walk because of my joints and how bad they hurt every day.
May have to put my fuzzy robe back on. Or not.
Now it's another thing. Would rather have the rash.
Well, looks like I have yet another embarrassing problem thanks to my eating disorder and my current body size. First it was the rash.
New read. #eatingdisorders #recovery #bingeeatingdisorder #selfesteem https://t.co/qbb2oNbUrs
Dammit, my doctor's office is closed. :(
@fiftyminus2 Oh my goodness, how wonderful! xx
@fiftyminus2 I love robins!
Realized I need to start going to NA meetings again, so tomorrow I'm off to my first one in about a month.
Just filled out my planner for next week. Gonna see how it all turns out. Busy week for sure.
I hear my step mom coming home, the garage door just opened.
Only 44 degrees and it's freezing in the house too.
I'm staying cozy in my robe for now. It's too chilly outside.
Well, where was that thunderstorm they were talking about???
I have a long to do list for next week! But it'll be good. Just trying to keep myself busy.
Bright green tree in the middle.  #Home #backyard #rainydays https://t.co/XPPnlgAOqh
Winds picking up too
Some way dark clouds just moved in...and it's still raining
@surelybutslowly Don't know! All I know is I didn't like it
@knuf1985 Yeah, it really does suck. Thanks so much, really appreciating the support.
Oh, don't know if I talked about this, but I went to a Food Addict Anonymous meeting. Didn't care for it. Sticking with OA for sure.
The rain is making me slightly happy though
Oh, and journaling too.
Tried using all my coping skills; music, warm bath, drinking hot tea, nothing.
And my mood plummets just like that.
Just answered my first phone call!
Chill day here at the office
@pixelsoulz That's good :)
Don't know if I'll be off at 5:00 or earlier since I came in early
Now officially starting my volunteer job today! So if I'm not on much that's why
@wdfarmer Okay! Good to know, thank you!
@pixelsoulz Oh I see :(
Holy SHIT, this rain is coming down!
Holy SHIT, this rain is coming down!
@BayePolar Haha, I'm glad it brought you a laugh! :D
@pixelsoulz I'm sorry :(
I just wanna keep eating and eating and eating. :/
Just made myself a grilled cheese, burnt it, ate it, and now I'm eating more food. And heating up my burrito. Wtf.
These things don't happen much!
How awesome that I'm eating a burrito on #nationalburritoday
@Christi_Renee14 I'm praying for her too. Sending lots of love to you.
Finally after such a long day I can relax.
I feel okay for the time being.
Just settling down watching Carnival Eats, listening to the rain and watching it fall, about to heat up my burrito from El Charro,
@Christi_Renee14 Take care of yourself during this time. xo
@Christi_Renee14 Oh my :( I'll pray too.
Appointment with the assessment counselor from the Regional Center went SUPER well. Yay!!!
@wdfarmer No. Not at all, actually.
@lilyrose1800 @TheSarahFader @lilyrose1800 Much love to you! xo
@Christi_Renee14 Oh no!! I'm sorry, love. Keep fighting. I'm here for you.
@Darlene44575635 @SemicolonTravel I'm so sorry @Darlene44575635 :(
@Darlene44575635 @SemicolonTravel That's good!
@LillianEMoffitt @TheSarahFader I used to take Lamictal, but I don't anymore. I didn't respond to it well. I hardly https://t.co/b0kMC4KzeP
@SemicolonTravel Oh wow. I didn't know that!
I can hear my dog snoring so clearly he's content.
I'm so nervous oh my god. Why why why. Yikes.
@SemicolonTravel Thank you for sharing that with me. &lt;3 I don't know what the stronger version is exactly, but I'm https://t.co/R4rqbrVAco
#ShoutOutYourMedChange As of right now, I'm on Prozac, Klonopin, Topamax, Gabapentin, Risperdal, and Abilify. They seem to work..for now..
#ShoutOutYourMedChange Since 2009, I've been on 18 different medications ranging from Celexa to Lithium to Latuda to Seroquel.
#ShoutOutYourMedChange In the last 4 years, I've been on and off of Gabapentin, Topamax, Prozac, Klonopin, Geodon, Abilify, it goes on.
Therapy went well! Now the intake coordinator for the North Bay Regional Center is coming over in less than an hour. Nervous...
Off to therapy appointment soon. With a new therapist. Wish me luck!
Woke up to the lovely sounds of rain today.
Good night all.
@25Years1Lesson Thank you! Now I'm off to bed
I wish it was closer.
Too bad the ANAD support group is in Petaluma and the bus schedule on Saturdays, the bus doesn't come until 9:57 am.
It's nice to know you're not alone.
Community group went really well tonight! I was glad that I could be part of a group that was so loving and welcoming.
I'll let you guys know how it goes. Signing off for now.
Why am I so nervous though?
Getting ready to go to my group soon.
Oh, and I did make that grilled cheese. I am not sorry.
Crossed more things off my to do list! Made a couple phone calls! I. Tackled. The Phone.
Excuse me, today is National Grilled Cheese Day??? Say no more!!!
I hear my neighbors moving their trash cans out. Garbage day is tomorrow.
Thank god it's gonna rain tomorrow, Friday, and Saturday.
Oh hey spring, whassup.
Out my window, I can literally see the pollen flying everywhere.
I keep thinking the door bell will ring at any second.
Now we have none. But I've crossed one thing off my to do list. Found an Al Anon meeting in my area plus support groups!
Ate the last two ice cream sandwiches. Oops.
Nothing. Nada. Zip.
Man, I just have no motivation to do anything today.
My book should be coming today :)
@PotataHed Exactly!! Today, I just can't seem to make any calls. Yesterday, fine. Today, a mess.
And yep, still in my pajamas.
The phone is still by my computer. Home phone and cell phone. Can't seem to make any calls and not one thing on my to do list is done.
Still in my pajamas. I can't seem to get dressed.
@Darlene44575635 Exactly. xx
@Darlene44575635 I know right!! Today is one of those days I just can't use the phone because of my anxiety.
That virtual knife or brick in your stomach. #ThisIsWhatAnxietyFeelsLike
Staring at the phone and feeling like it's going to eat you alive if it rings. #ThisIsWhatAnxietyFeelsLike
Getting tearful/crying every time you talk to someone. #ThisIsWhatDepressionLooksLike
New blog post! Specifically about what not to say to people recovering from ED's. https://t.co/KKeztIEPn1
Just took my Klonopin, a little on the late side but I took it.
Jeez, yesterday I was on fire making phone calls and everything. Today, I can barely function. #ThisIsWhatDepressionLooksLike
Going to community group at Full Heart tonight.
Had a long talk with my dad. It was good. Lots of crying though.
@Darlene44575635 Exactly!! Thank you! Sometimes, people just don't get it.
@PotataHed I know! :D
@PotataHed Thank you so much! Haha no, no smacking around is necessary at this time :)
My coffee is way too cold. Oh well.
@pixelsoulz Yep, for sure for sure!
@jhorton562 You're so right! Thank you so much for telling me that! :)
Excuse me while I go upstairs and go back to bed and/or listen to music.
And I know it must disgust you to see how fat I am, but you don't have to make it known. Jeez louise.
I know I need help, but come on, man.
Why say this to someone TRYING to recover from an eating disorder? You make no sense sometimes.
I mean, saying this like "You sure are eating a lot of carbs there, girl" really piss me off.
THIS DOES NOT HELP. Okay, end mini rant.
I just love being put on blast about the food I eat. Thanks a lot for that. &gt;:(
@jhorton562 Thanks :) trying to hang in there. Yesterday was kind of a decent day and today, well, not sure yet. But I'm trying
@Christi_Renee14 Yay that's good!!
@pixelsoulz Yeah, I suppose so. Good luck!
I don't want to get out of bed this morning...
@pixelsoulz I'm so sorry! :(
Tired.
My dog will not stop following me around and begging. Driving me nuts
And I'm getting cold. Better go get my sweater.
Phone calls, mostly phone calls. My psych appointment. Crossing off the to do list one thing at a time.
Today has certainly been productive!
Unfortunately my last appointment with her before I get transferred to the new team
And she knew about Full Heart and was glad to hear I was going to their open community meeting tomorrow night
Good appointment! Prozac got increased, which should hopefully help
Completely out of nowhere.
Like yesterday, had a really good doctor's appointment and came home with referrals like a dentist and eye doctors, then a mood shift came.
And I especially want to talk to my psychiatrist about these "mood shifts" I have. Even when everything is going well, they pop up.
@28DaysMore You have a lot going on! There is nothing wrong with you. &lt;3
She's always nice, but I still get nervous.
My psychiatrist appointment is less than an hour. Nervous. I hope I get my voice heard.
And thanks for that. Not.
Was making breakfast, then flipped out because I saw a spider in the sink out of the corner of my eye. Looked at the sink, no spider.
@pixelsoulz Thank you, friend!
@pixelsoulz Me neither sometimes
This hurts.
@twistedup_Nside Thank you!
I can't do dinner tonight.
I know I need this healthy food. I KNOW. But my ED says otherwise and arrrrrrrrgh
See? This is the shit that drives me crazy.
I know she'll make me eat it too. My ED voices do not like this.
Tonight for dinner my step mom is making chicken, quinoa, and salad. Arrrrrrrrgh not the salad.
And how bad my depression has been
I wrote my list of concerns for my psychiatrist for tomorrow, especially about my struggles with my eating
Now I'm prepping myself for my psychiatrist appointment for tomorrow
All in all, it was a good appointment! My doctor was a bad ass, I got refills I needed, and referrals I needed.
Especially Thursday in particular.
Looking at my week in my planner, and it looks pretty packed to me.
Dad should be on his way home soon, and then I'll be on my way to my doctor's appointment. #nervous #ugh
@soberboots Yes, exactly! Worth a try indeed!
I just so happened to find Food Addicts In Recovery and maybe that might help me more than OA? But I'm not sure. Never been to an FA meeting
Feeling a little bit better. Went on a walk with my dad and the dog, now looking up other support groups to try to join.
@25Years1Lesson I can't even get a good cry in. I just went on a walk with my dad and the dog and that helped some.
I just have no motivation today. I should shower because I didn't last night...
My step mom is insisting that I get a Pap Smear and a full female exam and it's like, this is a new patient appointment. Chill.
This includes referrals to a dentist, an eye doctor, and hopefully a gynecologist.
I have my appointment with my medical doctor today at 3:40 pm and hopefully I get everything I can out of it.
I woke up this morning feeling that way. Tried listening to my music, sometimes that makes me happy, and nothing.
@28DaysMore Me too. I sure could use a big one.
And I know someone is going to tell me to take a walk soon. Like why talk to anyone then.
I'm really trying to hang in there. Today's looking to be a long day.
I hate my eating disorder. I really do.
And once again the despair is creeping in.
Good morning everyone
May skip the shower and go straight to bed. Feeling kind of okay now.
Gonna try to go shower and relax.
Fuck. And I was quasi happy earlier. And even a little bit relaxed. And then the ED thoughts set in....
A real crisis counselor texts you back and everything.
Thank god I texted 741741 about my eating disorder. There is no shame in that.
I know I'm not, but all these bad feelings are creeping in.
I feel so utterly alone right now in this fight.
@Christi_Renee14 Yeah, that can happen. I've been in and out of hospitals myself so I know the feeling.
I feel my mind going places......
@Christi_Renee14 I've put on weight too; I have an eating disorder that causes me to binge eat and eat compulsively.
Had a sandwich when I got home; I was super hungry, I know I shouldn't let myself get like that.
Now to figure out my bus route for my doctor's appointment tomorrow afternoon.....
Finally caught the bus to the Transit Mall so I can make it back home!
@jhorton562 Thank you!
On a completely random note, #OpeningDay is here!!! Yasssssssss. Even though I'm not in LA anymore, I'm still excited for base of ball.
Finally the noisy kid in back of me is leaving. The fuck. And his mom wasn't telling him to be quiet or anything.
I was feeling anxious about the bus ride over so I took a Klonopin and just went for it.
Sebastopol is a fun town! I forgot that.
Hanging out at the Whole Foods in Sebastopol until the bus comes to the transit hub in about 45 minutes
@pixelsoulz Oh my gosh that's terrible :(
@pixelsoulz That's horrible!! :(
I hate feeling so sad.
@pixelsoulz I hope so too
But I don't miss having mixed episodes
And an inflated ego
Like right now. I'd be flooded with ideas and motivation
There are times I miss being hypomanic.
@pixelsoulz Yeah, see if he can help! That sucks your psychiatrist never calls or answers the phone :/
@pixelsoulz Then my psychiatrist added Lithium after that. Then things got worse. Maybe talk to your doctor?
@pixelsoulz It did for me too :(
I'm kind of nervous about it though.
In other words, I think I finally figured out my bus route to Sebastopol. Finally.
@PotataHed Thank you so much. &lt;3
I hate when I think I'm doing better and then boom.
Great. Just had a mini breakdown. :( ugh
Gonna keep working on getting better
Made some fresh fruit infused water. Step Momma is working in the garden/outside. Dad's watching the game. My mood's getting a little better
Trying to look for the right bus route to Sebastopol tomorrow. I'll ask Step Momma for some help.
I want to learn to like me, let alone love me. But it's gonna take a long ass time.
It's finally nice enough to use our barbecue :)
Made list for Trader Joe's. Gonna go buy my bus pass today. Step momma's making burgers for dinner on the grill tonight. (yum!)
Gotta take it an hour at a time.
Had a lovely conversation with my aunt. It was over an hour long.
Of course I could still get back in.....hmmmmm.
Too bad I stripped off all the sheets on my bed otherwise I'd get back in it. Ugh.
Really not feeling today. At all.
Cause when I'm depressed, I don't feel like doing anything. Walking? Forget it.
My dad told me I should go on a walk today and I refuse. I am not going on one. Not unless I have to walk the dog.
My dad and step mom are off to play pickle ball (whatever that is). And I'm just chillin.
I "tried" going back to sleep after waking up at 7:00 am. Even on days I can sleep in, I still get up early.
Woke up about an hour ago.
Well, woke up feeling verrrry depressed this morning. Skipping morning OA meeting. Just had breakfast. Took meds.
Alright, calling it a night Twitter verse. Good night guys!
Glad it's getting closer to bed time.
Heating up my burrito in the oven :D
My burrito from Oliver's awaits......
Just gotta keep putting one foot in front of the other..
Today has been frustrating on so many levels.
I am just exhausted and done and want this day to be over with.
I am just exhausted and done and want this day to be over with.
At least I got most of the things done on my long to do list this week.
@SherriR11 I needed to hear this right now
@SherriR11 Thank you. I hate eating disorders so much. :(
@PotataHed Thank you. I hope so :/ cause my struggles with this latest relapse of my eating disorder have been extremely tough.
@PotataHed Thank you for saying this, I needed it. I really appreciate it. I've been having a lot of hard days lately :(
I mean, how can one person be this sad?
The despair and sadness I feels too much to bear at the moment.
I still gave the one in Berkeley a call anyway just to see if they would take me. I don't want to lose this war. :(
Really losing hope here. Inpatient unit at UCSF only goes till age 26 (I'm 27) and the one in Berkeley is only for anorexia/bulimia.
@surelybutslowly It was very nice to get that gesture from people.
I'm determined not to binge today even though I'm surrounded by baguettes and bread at Boudin SF.
It really helps to have such loving communities in OA and on Twitter. I love you guys so much. You got me through a very bad day yesterday.
On the other side of the spectrum, cried my heart out at my OA meeting this morning. Everyone listened and gave me hugs at meeting's end.
Logged onto Twitter to see an outpouring of support towards my 5 month sobriety tomorrow. I'm very touched.
Wow, everyone thank you for all the support!!!
@SherriR11 Thank you so much! :D I really appreciate that!
Aw maaaaaan. My computer has 36% battery and the nearest outlet is so far away
@RichBiscuit21 Thanks! :D
@soberboots Yes, exactly!
April 1st, I'll be 5 months clean and sober.
@soberboots So did I. But now that my alcoholism is out of the picture and I'm clean and sober, my eating disorder' https://t.co/Kc5r8SYL2b
My friend gets out of her class in 50 minutes and not a moment too soon.
@susanne_blumer Thank you!
@susanne_blumer Thank you. I know it's my eating disorder talking, and I'm doing my best not to listen to it.
@soberboots Thank you Damien. I hate my eating disorder so much. :(
Like seriously
Well, binged/compulsively over ate even more. A sleeve of Oreos plus another cookie. I give up.
Now to recover from this binge. Trying to center myself and tell myself I'm not a bad person because I did this. I have an illness.
But this will suffice.
I love talking to my brother, whether it's through Facebook chat, calling, or texting. Of course I always miss face to face chats.
And now I want more food. But I have to save the rest of my money for dinner tonight.
$9.85 for four things. I remember when McDonald's used to be super cheap.
Just had a feast of McDonald's. Oops. It was an impulse decision.
Hanging out at the local junior college until my friend gets out of her class :)
I could use a nap almost
If only people knew how exhausting it is to undress, get in the shower, wash your hair and your body, dry off, get dressed, brush teeth.
I wish I had more inspiring things to say.
I don't know what to write for #worldbipolarday because I'm still getting used to the fact that that's my diagnosis :/
It's super windy here today so I can hear all the chimes in the backyard. So pretty.
Well, ended up going back to bed anyway. Felt good to go back to sleep. So good morning again. Lol.
Good morningggg, it is way too early to get out of bed
Gooood night everybody!
Just took out all the garbage in the whole house and rolled out the bins. I hope I didn't put them on the wrong side of the house
I think this is Cake Hunters I'm watching
Why is jeopardy so hard tonight
End rant
Mental illnesses are not adjectives!
"There's a lot going on with Theresa's display. It's a bit schizophrenic." a judge on cupcake wars said.
@pixelsoulz but that's just me!
@pixelsoulz they're addicting. Just a warning!
Livin' with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane
Now relaxing, watching Cupcake Wars, and chowing on some peanut butter pretzels
Toilet is fixed! :D
Considering where I started today, I rallied big time. I honestly can't believe I got so much done.
My life :( https://t.co/EDwViOvvqh
Having BBQ chicken pizza from Trader Joe's for dinner tonight. Yum yum.
Got a lotta shit done today! Wow, my brain is tired.
@Nottherealwavy Alright, will do! Thanks!
@mechanical_meat Yeah, true. Thanks!
And I just clogged up the toilet. Tried plunging it. Nothing is happening. #embarrassing #whatthefuck
Food diary. Now I just want to go back to bed and lie there.
Woke up at 8ish, had multiple breakfasts, made a small to do list, sent off an email (completing one item on that to do list), wrote in my
Woke up feeling even more drained. I thought sleep would help fix this.
Saying prayers and off to bed. Good night all.
@Ihatethisugh1 Not yet but I will :)
Emotionally drained, that is.
I'm so drained.
Can I go to bed yet?
@danielhortonseo :D
@pixelsoulz Ohh, yeah :/ it doesn't make you sleepy that's for sure
@danielhortonseo Got it
@pixelsoulz Not sure. I'm glad you're doing better though. &lt;3
@pixelsoulz Oh nooooooo :( I'm sorry
This is my blog post from two days ago (when I was in a not so good place; still in a not so good place). https://t.co/GZYZaSJSrx
Just for you @centre_recovery! https://t.co/b9TMEMfV9S
@pixelsoulz I was on Vistaril too. It did a whole lot of jack shit.
@centre_recovery Well, I recently posted a blog post from when I was in a not so good place too. But I posted one c https://t.co/7VDX0NhDXs
@danielhortonseo Oh really?
@28DaysMore Yeah, I set an alarm on my phone. And I'm home now. Got back from therapy and just had dinner :D
@susanroeder @hdbigjourney I did!
@mechanical_meat Thank you so much. &lt;3 hugs back.
It went from arm flapping to hand flapping to staring at my hands. Sigh....Aspie problems.
Anxiety starting to come down a little bit, but I can't stop staring at my hands. I wish I could stop doing this, especially in public.
Trying to drink water and just calm down. I hate being anxious in public places.
Just took my Klonopin. The pharmacist did say I could take it every 6 to 8 hours and it's been 6 hours...
@28DaysMore Well, I'm at a cafe now so that's distracting me a little. Can't tell if it's too early to take my meds or not. :/
Is it too early to take my Klonopin? I took it at 9:57 am......
My computer battery is at 44%
Well, not that many to some but too many for me.
And there are too many little kids in here. I just can't deal.
Getting really anxious again. Ugh. I hate this.
It smells like cinnamon raisins in the cafe I'm sitting in. &lt;3 yummy.
Just when I think I want kids, I hear a baby crying at a restaurant and think, "Nope. Maybe not."
@danielhortonseo Exactly! You can't come off these drugs cold turkey
@susanroeder @hdbigjourney No I wasn't able to :(
@susanroeder @hdbigjourney It's okay! I'm hanging out at a cafe now. Waiting to go to my therapy session at 5:00.
@danielhortonseo Bullshit :(
@danielhortonseo Oh. I see :(
@danielhortonseo Do it!!
Nervous about this upcoming appointment. I don't even know what it's for?
@danielhortonseo That's bullshit! I'm so sorry
@danielhortonseo Thank you. I'm here for you as well.
"You take my love for granted, I just don't understand it." -Drizzy
@danielhortonseo Thank you. Much appreciated. &lt;3
@danielhortonseo Not really doing that well, but hanging in there. :/
@danielhortonseo Wow. That's awful!
@danielhortonseo Ah. I see :( that sucks! I hope they give it to you soon!
@MindfullyBiPola I am so sorry your mom responded that way! :( That's terrible. My mom doesn't understand bipolar e https://t.co/th9s7RDOxC
Fresh cut grass aggravates my asthma like no other. And my allergies too.
I can smell the fresh cut grass inside and some of the windows aren't even open. Thank god I refilled my inhaler yesterday.
I have such little motivation for today really.
I have an appointment at 1 pm in Rohnert Park and therapy at 5 pm.
Sitting here in my fuzzy robe. Just wrote in my food diary and my gratitude list.
@danielhortonseo I've never actually taken Depakote before.
@danielhortonseo How many milligrams of Depakote are you on? I've been on a lot of meds, and it takes a long time to find the right ones :(
@susanroeder @hdbigjourney But I'm hanging in there. Thanks for checking in!
@susanroeder @hdbigjourney Thank you. So far, not really. Dreaded getting out of bed this morning because of depression and anxiety :/
Watching Unwrapped 2.0
The urges aren't as bad now. Still there, but not as bad.
@paul_JFT @soberboots @hopein12steps That's great! &lt;3
@paul_JFT @hopein12steps Exactly!
@soberboots @paul_JFT @hopein12steps Exactly!!
@susanroeder @hdbigjourney I believe so, I have some phone numbers.
@surelybutslowly @hdbigjourney It's a good fellowship!
@hdbigjourney Thank you, I'll try that! :)
@twistedup_Nside You don't have to put cucumber in it
@susanroeder @hdbigjourney Trying to promise that. Really trying not to think about bingeing.
@hdbigjourney Yes. I'm in Overeaters Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous (but I haven't been going to NA lately)
@hdbigjourney Thank you, trying!
@twistedup_Nside I put cucumber, lemon, and strawberries in mine.
@twistedup_Nside Thank you! &lt;3
@twistedup_Nside I've been drinking my fruit infused water.
@twistedup_Nside Trying to hang in there. Thank you.
I want to binge sooooo bad......
It's not easy, especially when you look at yourself and see how far you've fallen.
Trying to embrace myself for who I am...
And......I took my LAST dose of Keflex!!!!
And find an eye doctor in my area. Or call my dad's eye doctor.
Fruit infused water. Now to make dinner soon.
Glad to say I got a lot done! Picked up prescriptions at two pharmacies, did a light grocery shop, set up my online banking, and did my
@susanroeder @menhealuk Yes. For sure.
@menhealuk @susanroeder I'm so sorry :( I hope things get better for you.
@Nottherealwavy Thank you &lt;3 I'm glad too :)
@menhealuk @susanroeder Exactly! It really does screw one up :(
The sun is playing peek-a-boo
@Nottherealwavy I'm so sorry you're going through this :(
@susanroeder :D
@susanroeder Thank you so much!!
It's my own fault really
My back is killing me, and I know why :(
@susanroeder Exactly.
@susanroeder I try to drown people's voices out of my head from the past that have told me that taking care of myself was selfish.
@susanroeder Thank you for saying this! &lt;3 I do forget that self care is not selfish sometimes.
It's the little kid in me that wishes my dad was retired so he could spend time with me again like the good old days. :(
@susanroeder Exactly! It was so relaxing sitting outside :D
I've only done one thing on my to-do list. Eeeeeek......
Going on an outing soon to pick up my med refills and what not.
It was nice sitting in the sun.
Went for a walk at the insistence of my dad..walked down to the church, sat outside, made a couple phone calls.
@bipolar4good No everyone was here, they were just working on their computers so they were quiet haha
Normally I like it, but today it just feels weird??
It's so quiet in this house D:
@surelybutslowly @hdbigjourney Thank you! &lt;3
It's raining. &lt;3
@pixelsoulz I know, seriously! :)
@hdbigjourney @susanroeder @surelybutslowly So true!!
@susanroeder Thank you so much! &lt;3
https://t.co/b9TMEMfV9S @surelybutslowly @hdbigjourney Just for you! :D
Onions always smell good when they're cooking. Step momma is making chili for dinner tonight. Yummmmmm. #homecooking #sonomacountyliving
@hdbigjourney @surelybutslowly Thanks!
@surelybutslowly Thank you. &lt;3
@surelybutslowly Thank you &lt;3 then I might post a link then I suppose.
And besides who wants to read my shit anyway
I was going to post a link to my recent blog post (2 days ago) but that's when I was in a happier place. :(
God I hate feeling my feelings. They really suck.
Keep breathing. Keep breathing. I am here. I am okay. It's just the anxiety.
Keep breathing. Keep breathing. I am here. I am okay. It's just the anxiety.
The Wellbutrin must still be in my system some.
Why am I so antsy? Arrrrrgh.
My dad is watching March Madness so the TV is on. Just took my mid day meds.
That leftover pizza is calling my name though.
Or something. I don't know.
Maybe I can get a coffee while I'm out.
Looking forward to going out of the house soon. Going to get a planner so I can plan out my days, likely at Marshall's.
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
Maybe I should do some more journaling? I don't know. Completely at a loss.
Aw. One of my OA sisters just sent me a text asking how I was doing completely out of the blue. &lt;3
Is this ever going to stop?
Woke up sad today.
I'm almost done with my fucking Keflex. Thank god.
I'm still struggling.
So whew! Got that phone call out of the way. But also a bummer that my depression still isn't even being targeted by any of my meds.
Different story. She told me to stop the medication and see my psychiatrist as soon as I can.
She told me that my depression is not from the medication because it hasn't been in my system for that long. However, the anxiety is a
Called the Crisis Stabilization Services at where I see my psychiatrist. Got a fantastic nurse and I explained my side effects to her.
@pixelsoulz I hated it too. I know. I hate leaving my house too
@pixelsoulz That's good. I used to work at a grocery store and I had to deal with people all day long.
@pixelsoulz Exactly!! Seriously! I don't work either. I haven't worked for a year and a half, almost two years.
On the bright side, I went to a great OA meeting this morning
@pixelsoulz Me too! I hated getting them at work when I used to have a job. It was awful.
The mood shifts, the depression, and a bunch of shit I just wrote down on my legal pad just shows I'm having side effects to the med.
Given what's going on, I may have to go off my Wellbutrin if that's even what's causing my symptoms :(
@pixelsoulz Thank you :(( I hate them so much. I'm home now thank god.
When you have a mood shift in public:
Probably heading to bed soon
@paul_JFT All very true points!! &lt;3
Ahhhh, a quiet house except for the dog pitter pattering. Peaceful.
@pixelsoulz Maybe! I hope so
@pixelsoulz Boy do I wish the same thing
@SemicolonTravel I needed this today. Thank you for saying it. &lt;3
@hopein12steps Thank you! &lt;3
@pixelsoulz Wow, that's awful! :(
@pixelsoulz That's what happened to me on Geodon. I smoked like a chimney when I was on that drug it was awful. :/
@pixelsoulz Good. That's good you're going to see him. I hope he gives you something that will help you!
I know I should stop tweeting about my ED struggles, but this is my life currently. I've been journaling a lot today.
@pixelsoulz I'm sorry :(
@pixelsoulz Wtf that sucks! Why did your doctor take you off the Xanax, especially if it was helping you? :(
I just want to eat everything. The obsessions are here and always are.
@pixelsoulz I'm sorry :( how many mg of Seroquel are you on?
And trying to do everything I can to get my ED recovery back.
Well, I am calm just sad.
Trying to keep calm and just breathe and focus.
@pixelsoulz Yikes! I'm on Risperdal and Abilify right now. They're trying to taper me off Risperdal but the halluci https://t.co/TOmR0NdaiH
@paul_JFT Thank you for this. &lt;3
@pixelsoulz Ooh damn. I was on Seroquel too. I hated that shit. I was on Zyprexa as well and got terrible cravings. I know the feeling!
@Uberdead Thank you!
Made lists for the grocery store. Taking it a little at a time here. Trying to figure out what my next blog post is going to be about.
So no. I'm not drinking over binge urges. Nope.
I know what would fix this. And it would break my sobriety.
*deep breaths* Stay strong. Stay strong. Stay strong.
I just want to eat everything.
But on a serious note guys, ARGH I STILL WANT MORE FOOD. THIS IS BS. I know this is my eating disorder talking.
Threw the recycling away outside and my socks got wet so I had to change socks. But I put on my kick ass pink and black fuzzy socks.
I know I tweet about mundane shit, but isn't that what Twitter is for sometimes?
For someone who loves the rain so much, I really should live in Seattle. *laughing emoji*
Home now! Sitting at the dining room table watching the rain fall. #sopeaceful #stormyweather #rain
It's what my ED wants.
I want a cookie really bad, but once I eat one, I'm going to want more and spend even more money..
Rainy days sure bring in the crowds.
I like the music that's playing inside here.
And I'm in public so I'm pretty sure everyone is looking at me...
Waiting for my anti anxiety med to kick in so I'm not so fidgety :/
It sure is pouring out there!
Just burned my tongue on my coffee. Fuck.
Met some new people too. And met a familiar face from when I used to go to other OA meetings four years ago!
Went to my Friday OA meeting. It's raining. Meeting was good. Got a ride to Montgomery Village. Chillin at Acre Coffee. Winning.
Good night, guys!
@abbie_grrl Yes we can!
Perhaps I may take a shower.
@soberboots @seanpaulmahoney Thank you! :)
@soberboots @seanpaulmahoney Thanks, trying! :)
@seanpaulmahoney @soberboots Thank you!
@soberboots Okay. Will do.
@soberboots Thank you. Trying to stay strong.
Lemon is the best flavor of La Croix water. Hands down.
Funny nonetheless.
It's good to know that my dog wanders around the house like I do. What he's looking for? I have no idea.
Like, "Hi, I'm Simone and I have Asperger's! Forgot the big sign to put around my neck. Just thought you should know."
It's awkward to tell someone about it when I get to know them.
My dad and step mom think I have to talk about my ASD at every chance I get. To a professional, it's one thing. But to someone I just met?
@MoreThanDSM5 Me too
Also having cravings for booze like mad. So I really have to stay strong.
Trying to find little things to be happy about and to be grateful for even though I'm struggling hard core right now.
Back home now. The wind is blowing so much I can hear the chimes in the back yard :) so pretty. &lt;3
@LiveSober80 Thank you! xx
@KShashoua I love this. Thank you.
Oh well. Hanging out at the mall for the time being until I can get my connection bus back.
So the OA meeting moved to a new location. I feel so stupid for not knowing sooner
@KShashoua Thank you!
@THorning5 Thanks!
I can do this.
Lost that battle. But I'll win others :)
Fighting eating disorder relapses are the pits
I'll do my best though
But I honestly don't see that happening.
Really gonna try not to act on my binge urges today
Gonna hang out at Oliver's Market before my meeting.
I didn't know the seats were so nice and comfy
I'll be on here for a bit
Riding the bus! Yay!!!
Going to an OA meeting in town. And I'm taking the Santa Rosa city bus for the first time!!
@mechanical_meat Thanks! I did
Will be back on in the maana!
Good night all.
It was good just to get it all out
Had an awesome therapy session today
Also waiting for my dad to print out daily routine schedule templates for me so I can write my stuff in. He's the best. :D
So hanging out at a coffee shop commences! What better thing to do on a rainy day, right?
Therapy appointment is at 5:30 today. But leaving in less than an hour because Dad and step mom have shit to do.
This weather sure is wild! Rain, hail, sun, and now more clouds are coming in. Cray.
But something is stopping me....
I really want to apply to my local junior college
It's almost noon??? Where did the time go?
@getbackup089 So have I. :( It's not easy!
@mechanical_meat Oh good! I'm glad to hear that! I'm on 150 mg extended release
https://t.co/sjb7BYsFVO New post!
Psych appointment went well. Took me off hydroxyzine and put me back on clonazepam. Also added Wellbutrin.
@knuf1985 Thank you
@soberboots Thanks!! It did
Psycho appointment today. Why am I so nervous?
Like, what if I don't have the head for that right now?
I'm trying to keep myself busy. My step mom keeps telling me to read a book.
Even though I just became a volunteer at NAMI and start on the 31st, I still can't be happy.
I'm glad it's raining. At least the weather matches my mood...
@knuf1985 I don't get auditory ones that much. So when I get hallucinations at all, I freak out
Wondering what the day will bring
Wondering what's in store for me today...
@knuf1985 Yeah, they really suck :( I'm sorry you're going through them too
And what's making this day worse is I'm having visual hallucinations again
Hiding in my room listening to the radio. I tried being social..I really tried
@Christi_Renee14 Yeah. For sure. I hope tomorrow is better for both of us.
Today's just been hard. :(
I'll try to rally for them.
My dad and step mom's friends are coming over tonight....and I'm so not ready for that.
@Christi_Renee14 I'm having a shitty day too. :(
@danielhortonseo Lithium didn't agree with me either. It made me super aggressive and hostile.
@THorning5 Yeah, a little
You all got me through a very rough patch. I'm still feeling delicate but not as bad as I was.
The outpouring of support I got from you all is so appreciated and I love you guys.
@soberboots Thank you so much!!
@djfrank44 True.
@djfrank44 Thank you. I wish I felt strong
@djfrank44 I needed this. Thank you.
@djfrank44 @soberboots Thank you so much
@THorning5 Did! Went for 2.
@jhorton562 Thank you for this.
I thought I was through all of this?
It's only 11:50 am and I'm struggling so bad
Argh and so far it's not  every day is a fucking battle
I hope tomorrow will be better
How could I have been so repulsed by just the sight of booze earlier and all of a sudden crave it?
@MrsKrazyMonkey Me too.
What the absolute fuck.
I can't drink. I can't use. I've got nothing left to do.
Because we're having dinner soon? Uhh no we're not. I don't see anyone cooking or the table set. So annoying
Fuck! The only thing I can control the only thing I have left...I can't even have a snack???
@Ihatethisugh1 @BeyondBrokenDep Thank you
Blah. :/
Now sipping a coconut milk mocha macchiato from Starbucks sitting at Safeway
Interview went well!! Yay!!!!
@hellobipolar Anytime.
@hellobipolar So sorry you're going through this. Anything I can do to help?
@thecupcakegirl8 I'm sorry you're dealing with that. :( hugs
@soupernic Yay!!! That's fantastic!
I really wish I knew how to drive so I could be more independent....
@danielhortonseo Thank you. :)
@soupernic That's awesome!  I think it will really help me get out of my head.
Interview/meet up with someone from NAMI tomorrow to see if I can become a volunteer!
@djfrank44 Thank you
On top of that, may have another bladder infection brewing  dammit and I just took a 10 day course of Keflex
Damn you, anxiety
Just when I thought it went away, it came roaring back.
Yep.. still anxious..
@THorning5 Oh wow! Yeah, much better than LA. That's where I moved from.
I hate you, anxiety. Please go away.
@THorning5 Oh okay, very nice. Santa Rosa is beautiful, it's In Northern California.
@THorning5 Ah. Where are you from?
Having urges. Ugh.
Having urges. Ugh.
I want to binge eat....
Grateful for every day clean and sober. #odaat #sobriety #addiction
@THorning5 I like the rain actually!
And rain today. What do you know...
So tired..
The weather is so nice. I really should go for a walk.
Finally back at my dad's house!
@paul_JFT Thank you!
I hate throat and lymph node infections
Being sick sucks :(
@OatiePaul Much better!
@OatiePaul Thanks!!
@SherriR11 Thank you! And yes indeed
The hydroxyzine doesn't help right away, but it does eventually
Just took my noon dose of Gabapentin and my PRN for my anxiety. Hopefully this should help. Been anxious all morning long.
@paul_JFT @soberboots Yes. Very true. Too much exposure to people and I burn out too. Healthy self care is important!
@paul_JFT It really does! :(
@1957Mom Thanks so much!
@susanroeder Thank you!!
I love long phone chats with friends
@momgosomething Thank you
@paul_JFT Thank you so very much  I appreciate that!
@centre_recovery Thank you!!
@soberboots Me too. It's rough. Thanks for all the encouraging words!
4 months of sobriety and counting. Looking forward to 5 months
Don't know if I'll get to any meetings today. My isolation and social anxiety are back
Can't wait for my discharge on Tuesday from the program I'm in. I will (hopefully) write a blog post soon
Everyone says I'm still the same person as i ever was
Yes I've changed a lot, but who am I now?
I feel like a completely different person and I don't know who I am anymore.
Why is it always so cold in this room...
It's either that or the Risperdal or both.
Can't seem to stop eating even though I'm not hungry. Thanks ED...
@knuf1985 That's good that she ate. Prayers and good vibes being sent.
Looking forward to going to Shabbat services and dinner afterward with my dad.
@knuf1985 So sorry. :(
I really wanted ice cream and cookies
My card got declined at 7-11 again. Don't know why, it should have money on it. Just deposited a check in there...
@thecupcakegirl8 I'm so sorry, dear. :( I'm battling a lot of emotions myself. Hugs.
@CJMead30 Yep. We both do. Keeping you in my thoughts today.
@Nottherealwavy Me too
@CJMead30 Thank you.
I miss being happy.
Now to figure out what to do...I hate down time sometimes
@paul_JFT @soberboots Amen!! It does work!
@soberboots Thank you
Just trying to get through today.
I know that's bad...
Minus going out to my psychiatrist appointment I've been in my room and bed most of the day...
@soberboots @paul_JFT Yes. Exactly.
@soberboots @paul_JFT Still not well, but hanging in there
Went to an amazing NA meeting last night.
@paul_JFT @soberboots Thank you for reaching out to me! Much appreciated.
@soberboots Thank you for this. I needed to hear it
@soberboots I hope so :/ it doesn't feel like it will though
Been in an ED relapse for awhile. Hope I can find my footing again soon
I hate eating disorder relapses. They're the fucking worst.
@soberboots Thank you for this.
@knuf1985 Thank you so much.
Really struggling today
Okay is it bed time yet?
Changed my bed sheets. It's the little things...
@CJMead30 Thank you.
When people say you're not really autistic:
@Darlene44575635 Yeah. It's rough. I'm sorry you're feeling the same way :(
@surelybutslowly Thank you.
@jhorton562 Thank you  I really appreciate that
@SherriR11 Yeah exactly :((
@SherriR11 Right!! Exactly! And I just moved to a new area so I have to start all over again and it's just been really hard :(
@CJMead30 Wish I could. I'm in a program right now :/
The weather matches my mood
I wish I had more friends in real life.
I hate this
And the loneliness and sadness strike again...
Going out for breakfast with my dad soon
Hopefully I can write a blog post today too
@paul_JFT @surelybutslowly
@OatiePaul @KE11072010 Yes. Exactly.
Having dinner at my dad and step mom's tonight! So stoked!
@OatiePaul @KE11072010 Yeah, that's why I'm trying NA next because I was an addict also
@OatiePaul @KE11072010 Yeah, true.
@SherriR11 I will! Thank you!
@SherriR11 Thank you. I'm sure there must be
@paul_JFT @surelybutslowly Thank you so much!
@paul_JFT @surelybutslowly Yeah exactly! I got sober in Los Angeles and maintained sobriety there
@abbie_grrl Thank you! I will!
@KE11072010 I've been keeping an open mind. Well, trying :/ i don't know what's wrong with me
@Ihatethisugh1 I've been trying to, I don't seem to be successful
@surelybutslowly Yeah. It does :/
@Ihatethisugh1 Santa Rosa, Northern California. I used to live in Los Angeles
@surelybutslowly Yeah. It's awful. Makes me miss where I used to live because they had better meetings  I hope I can find good ones soon
It's hard adjusting to living somewhere new
I seriously feel so lonely right now. Makes me miss Los Angeles and my circle of AA people I had
How am I supposed to stay sober and connected to sober people if there are no good meetings? Argh.
Frustrated as fuck. Can't find any good meetings where I live. :'(
I know I should do my laundry. I have a lot of it....but it seems so overwhelming.
The program I'm in I'm supposed to see the doctor every week
Seriously struggling. Why they didn't schedule me to see the doctor this week is beyond me
This day is dragging on...
@BayePolar Yeah. It sucks. I'm sorry you go through it too :(
But thank god i have all of you.
And no one is texting me back
I'm so sick of feeling this way
@BayePolar Thank you. I have that knife in the stomach feeling.
@Pr0udCanad1an1 Thank you so much
Anxious.
@Pr0udCanad1an1 Thank you, trying
@milesawaygirl98 I'm sorry. Hang in there!
@milesawaygirl98 Me too
Yes please. I need all the food https://t.co/y9z2s0XyHz
@thecupcakegirl8 Aw sweetie  I'm so sorry
@BayePolar I hate that feeling. No fun at all.
@knuf1985 I'm struggling too and it's not even noon. Hugs to you
@accordingtokenz Praying!!!
And then seeing my friend who I haven't seen in forever
Found a good one! Always good
I'm sure there are other ones out there though
Hate it when I get bad vibes at a meeting :( and have to leave
Can't seem to stop eating..well, I guess it's a coping skill too. Too paralyzed by my feelings to do much else.
@milesawaygirl98 Thank you  it's hard
@milesawaygirl98 I'm sorry that's happening.
I hate this
@milesawaygirl98 Not really. The depression is bad, but I'm trying to hang in there. It's hard though
@milesawaygirl98 Where are you going?
@milesawaygirl98 I'm sorry. Keeping you in my thoughts
@milesawaygirl98 I'm sorry  same here
Sure wish I could stop feeling so lonely
Looks like walk is happening soon!
Nice weather for a walk! But where to go?
At a loose end....
@knuf1985 Thank you! :)
@wearesober Sorry you had to go through what you did, but I'm glad the Zoloft works!
And no hallucinations! Even better
Well, so far the Prozac isn't making me hypo manic. A good sign
@wearesober Thank you so much!
@wearesober Sending you happy vibes!!!
I hope it doesn't make me hypo manic. It hasn't before. So fingers crossed. But I'm relieved for the changes.
Finally saw a doctor!!! I've been waiting for days now. But my hydroxyzine got upped for my anxiety and I got put on Prozac.
@alwaysunstable So true. :(
822 followers!? Thank you guys so much!
And all of a sudden, the texts stop coming. If this is awkward, I wish I would be informed.
Only problem is my anxiety is bad right now
Sitting outside enjoying the sunshine. Finally the rain made its way out!
@lost_an_found_ Thank you
@fiftyminus2 Wow those are pretty!!
Plant near the creek. #naturewalks #pictures https://t.co/2ugTlPVn6c
Wall art. #murals #naturewalks https://t.co/4i7R3vmgvh
@BayePolar Yeah, it's a waiting game for sure :/
@fiftyminus2 Thank you.
@fiftyminus2 This brought me to tears. Thank you so much.
@BayePolar I'm sorry, my friend
Trying to hang in there the best I can
My depression is so bad today...
Listening to my house mate sing. She has a pretty voice
@SherriR11 Love you too, and thank you. It gets tough. Thanks for your kind words
@SobrietyDuck Thanks, so far it's not really anxiety wise. But I'm hanging in there!
And when it's not sadness, it's anxiety. Hopefully my medication kicks in soon
@SobrietyDuck Thank you so much
@LiveSober80 Thank you xx
Just too sad today. Ugh.
@LiveSober80 Yes, exactly! One day at a time
@LiveSober80 Yes, exactly! One day at a time
@abbie_grrl Thanks sweetie! Xo
@centre_recovery Thank you!!!!
@AIRWearRecovery Thanks so much!!
106 days of sobriety.
Intake appointment today. So nervous. :/
@thecupcakegirl8 I'm so sorry
Gonna try to stay dry as much as I can
It is pouring rain out here this morning!
Went to my first AA meeting in maybe two months! Felt good.
@recovery_chic Thank you my dear
@susanroeder Thank you!!
@SherriR11 Thank you!!!
@Onelostcompass Thanks so much!!
Loving it
Man, this rain is coming down.
@AmbAdAstra Thank you!!!

Thanks everyone
@marktwist91 Thank you!!
@SocialAnxtDad Thank you
The anxiety is bad today
It's a good feeling
Feeling more like myself today
Got my phone back!!!!
@25Years1Lesson Thank you for your support! xo
Looks like a nice rainy day in Sonoma County :)
Hopefully I can explore my options here and am happy to call this place home. My old stomping grounds. &lt;3
Needless to say, a lot's happened. But I left my program and moved to Sonoma County to live with my dad and step mom.
About me. xo
Hi everyone! Haven't been on Twitter in awhile, but so touched to see I have so many followers still and that you all haven't forgotten
Last tweet for a year! Wishing all of you a happy new year and may 2017 be a better year for us all.
Last night in Sonoma county! Momma's making burgers tonight
#mondaymotivation Just feeling so fucking grateful. Got into the program I wanted. I anxiously await my new beginnings. &lt;3
Cheers to new beginnings!!!
This is what I've needed all along, for a very long time.
Tomorrow at 2 pm. I'm excited.
PRAYERS ANSWERED AND WHAT A RELIEF: open bed at Via Avanta in Pacoima for me!! I'm going to use as much social media as I can before
@LiveSober80 Me too :(
@cassieglows @soberboots @surelybutslowly Thanks!!!!
@KEvans11072010 Thank you so much for all your the tips!
@Jay3AA Thank you!!
@SherriRheaume Thank you!
@KEvans11072010 Yeah!! That's what happens to me!!
@KEvans11072010 I'll definitely try it :)))
@KEvans11072010 Oh wow! No I haven't! But thank you
I chose this as my profile picture because that smile is a real smile. And it's my first genuine smile in months. https://t.co/HrsJ9yxO2B
Sonoma County's beauty. #fall #natureisbeautiful #godscreation #inlove https://t.co/TAlKfjnFfu
And I'm trying the Sleepytime tea tonight and the English Breakfast Tea in the morning just for a switch up of coffee.
I've become quite the tea drinker as of late. I love the Well Rested chamomile and mint tea, the Autumn Apple Rooibos Tea from TJ's
@KEvans11072010 Thank you for these words. &lt;3 It means a lot to have support on here
@FrankvanNie @knuf1985 Of course. &lt;3
Wtf. And he is making the most pitiful sounds
My dog will not stop begging and whining. This is only exacerbating my irritability. He was already fed. Just took him out so he could pee.
@FrankvanNie @knuf1985 A mixed episode is when someone experiences manic and depression symptoms with bipolar
New post! https://t.co/CkjvBBP5Ah
@knuf1985 @FrankvanNie For me, it can be a signal that I'm headed into a mixed episode. But I'm not sure this time. It sucks.
@markmellorjones Thank you so much. xx
Writing a blog post :D
Thank you everyone, this is why I love my #TwitterFamily
I don't need to hide under an alias anymore and it feels so freeing.
and by the way, Ciara Marie was my alias. My real name is Simone Jane Brodey.
@soberboots Thank you Damien.  I really needed to hear that
@hdbigjourney @KEvans11072010 Thank you both  it's just hard to experience
Felt like this last night too. Gonna try to go back to bed and see if that helps
It feels like I'm here, but I'm not "here". It's so odd.
It just feels like everything is clouded and foggy. I feel disoriented and have trouble following conversations or engaging in them.
Im in a really weird mental state right now. I can't even explain in words. It's not sadness, anxiety, hypomania, or numbness.
@AmbAdAstra Pretty much my life. My birth mom always did that shit to me
@Crymsen_Skye Feeling the same way. :(
@danielhortonseo Me too :/
@AmbAdAstra Yep, it will be! A dinner out with my parents, what could be better? :D
Also a gorgeous picture. The sun hitting the tree in the front yard. &lt;3 #nature #fallfavorites #colorful https://t.co/2DXXV58otY
Spritzed a few drops of her In Love Again perfume. It smells warm and comforting; and a woman who loves herself. #PositiveVibes
First time in MONTHS wearing make up! But I only did it subtly. A little goes a long way. I'm wearing my new cute clothes my mom got me &lt;3
@markmellorjones I know! This was taken at a little past sunrise. Too good of an opportunity to miss!
From this morning.  https://t.co/F3nsJrPi2O
Started my morning with an amazing walk into Annadel State Park. 37 degrees, but worth it!
@mymameisrichard Thank you very much. Xoxo
Better days are here.
@mymameisrichard Thank you!! I appreciate the support
@Bobby_Steps Thank you! I did go today and I'm going to one tomorrow too
Anxious as fuck right now. I hate this shit.
Thank you everyone for all your support!!!  so much gratitude to express
Hit 30 days sober from alcohol today!! So proud of myself
Good morning everyone!
@mechanical_meat Thanks!! I did
Bed time. Good night all
710 followers!?!? I love you guys!!! So much.
And finally got my hair cut evenly with some layers haha. I definitely fucked up my hair back in September when I was hypomanic
About to have halibut, baby potatoes, and asparagus for dinner. Cannot wait.
Sipping on some hot tea, ate some cookies, and I'm just chillin.
Animals are great
Been around Biscuit so long and being around Lizzie's fur babies, I'm so used to doggies now :)
I think Cosmo (my step mom's dog) has arthritis. He is 14 years old after all. Starting to move like me. Poor baby :(
42 degrees. Thank god for warm and fuzzy blankets!
@fluffybipolar Me too!
@Crymsen_Skye
Supposed to get real chilly tonight
Finally made it! Feels good
@OliviaKMaynard So sorry love! :(
@Crymsen_Skye I'm so sorry. :( you're in my thoughts
@Crymsen_Skye I could go for a smoke too right now
@Crymsen_Skye you okay???
Forgot how bad the traffic is until 4 lanes narrow down to 2..
@Crystalielie Exactly!!!
@Crystalielie and it's always so embarrassing standing outside a public bathroom doing the 2 step like a toddler
@Crystalielie yeah it's a bummer :/
@AmbAdAstra I bet!! Like, I feel like my dad who needs to use the bathroom all the time. I seriously feel your pain!
One sip of water and I need to pee
Damn this fucking hydrochlorothiazide. It's a new medicine to lower my BP but it's also a diuretic.
Why are baby animals so cute!?!
Just saw baby calfs. Omg.
@LucyLu_Life Sending love your way!!
Can't wait to see what meetings are in Santa Rosa!
Just did some writing on the train. It was awesome.
Met a family on their way to San Francisco. Beautiful family. This is what life is about, talking to people, and being comfortable with you.
#MyMorningRoutineIncludes breakfast, coffee, Third Step prayer, meditation, and journaling.
Even while traveling, I can still meditate and work the steps. Did a 4th step and meditated for 20 minutes. #XA #RecoveryPosse
@25Years1Lesson Thank you!!
Wish I could say the same thing with my binging/compulsive overeating, but I have no idea where to even start.
As of June 22nd, I haven't purged for 5 months. #edrecovery #ednos #bulimia
27 days. So grateful and blessed. December 1st will be 30 days!!! #XA #addictionrecovery
Going to the Bay Area for a week to visit my dad and step mom tomorrow! :D
Got packing to do, a train ticket to book, phone calls to make, and self care to do. #mondaymotivation
The most painful memories are when Facebook shows you on this day and you're reminded of when life was pretty good.
So tired...
Wtf this phone needs charging again....
Can't wake up cause I dream all night.. Puddle of Mudd
I'm not having cravings tonight. What a relief. But I am getting my ass to a meeting tomorrow.
@accordingtokenz It rained here so my whole body hurt and all I did was stay in bed till 5 pm.
@accordingtokenz Me too, as a person who gets migraines three times a month and has fibro.
@AmbAdAstra @empty__space__ Feeling the same way. :( but I'm just trying to stay busy
@knuf1985 Me too, probably
And people talking about weight loss and health. My weight is my last problem. Focusing on my sobriety is a challenge on its own.
Diet talk two days after thanksgiving. Almost left the room. Talking about shit I did not need to hear. #mentalhealth #eatingdisorders
Feeling so sad and low today. :(
Well, never went. Ugh. Cannot make up my mind today on anything.
Off to a meeting in Silver Lake
25 days!!!
Thank you so much everyone!!
And ended up in the emergency room again. Migraine this time..just left.
Thanks everyone for all the support! Means a lot!!!
Fucking hell, of course a pigeon took a giant shit on my shirt. I don't have an extra one so I'm wearing a tank top in 58 degree weather
@soberboots Thanks Damien, you're awesome!
@LiveSober80 Thanks honey! xx
@birdieartie @Bobby_Steps Thank you guys so much!!!
Even though it's 55 degrees, I wear a sweater but will still drink iced cold brew.
@surelybutslowly hi!!
@surelybutslowly Thank you so much!
I never in my life thought I was an addict to anything besides the bottle. But I've come to terms with a lot of things
And I'm 1 year clean from opiates as of 10/27/15.
Hi, my name is Ciara and I'm an alcoholic/addict. Today, I'm 24 days sober from alcohol. As of 01/182014, I'm 2 years clean from pot.
Paradise.  https://t.co/4rQJMvXoBt
Thank you!!! https://t.co/9NdmDS2cXp
@BipolarHeaded Thank you for this.
Be kind to yourselves guys. #Mentalhealth #eatingdisorders #substanceabuse #holidayscanbehard
As I was unable to get to a meeting today, my walk on the beach was my meeting. #XA #addiction #alcoholism
Now just hanging out with Biscuit and meeting some new fur babies. Listening to the waves crash on the rocks
Went on an amazing walk on the beach earlier.
For those of you in LA County the number is 323-936-4343. In the SF Valley, their number is 818-988-3001.
And for my fellow sober brothers and sisters, call your central office and see what thanksgivings you can go to!
And for those who don't have places to go on thanksgiving, I'm here to talk to. xx
And my doggie gets to run around on the beach
Spending it in Malibu at my family friend's beach house.  should be fun
Happy Thanksgiving!!!
@SherriRheaume Thank you for this! I needed to hear it
@BiggieSmalley Very true.  thank you
I wish I wasn't so sensitive to people just telling me things
I cannot make more mistakes today and pray that I don't
I cannot be criticized for anything else or I'll fold
Now feeling like a hot mess again.
But on the other hand, I have 22 days of sobriety!! #XA #recoveryroad
I feel like a hot mess this morning. So nervous.
@Wayward_LDS Thank you so much
and when I'm hypomanic I feel amazing
I just want to feel good
I just want to feel good
I want to go off my meds so bad
I hope a depressive episode isn't on the way...I've been without my Abilify for a few days and haven't taken my Lamictal for a few days.
I hate feeling so sad. Fuck.
Love coffee chats with friends
Praying for him instead of being angry at him.
Got told to hurry up by someone in line at Starbucks. Didn't take it personally. He's either in a hurry or having a bad morning.
Can't sleep so why not get to an early meeting?
@surelybutslowly @birdieartie Exactly! Thank you so much
@birdieartie Thank you for the tips!
@BiggieSmalley Aw that's cute!!
@xxloopixx hi my dear! xx
@bipolar4good good night. And good morning to you :)))
@soberboots Thank you! This is why I love you guys
Good night everybody.
@soberboots But I will for sure have my phone handy!
@soberboots Cause the actual day of Thanksgiving I won't be able to go to meetings that day..
@soberboots Yeah, I'm worried about it. Gotta make sure to go to a lot of meetings before Wednesday and thanksgiving day
@25Years1Lesson I don't think so :( Already have 20 people coming
@VanRyan Thank you, love! xx
He was checking to make sure I was okay. &lt;3 animals are great that way!
My dog is seriously the best. I said "ow" because my tea was really hot while I was putting it down and he came over to the table.
@RDW2303 Thanks, you as well!
@RDW2303 Ohh! Pardon my mistake  congrats on 14 months!!!
@bipolar4good Thank you!
@ELECTR0N1TE I'll DM you
That and the holiday season is tough for many people. Not just me.
Really stressed about Thanksgiving..eating disorder wise and sobriety wise. No wonder I've been feeling so down lately.
@bipolar4good Of course love! xxx
@RDW2303 So very sorry you're going through this. Relapse is so difficult. I've relapsed so many times. I have 19 days clean youre not alone
Feeling much better. I was like a cranky 2 year old who needed time out. =/

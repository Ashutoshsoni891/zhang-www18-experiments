@ChristNme true there. I would put a few rounds of 9mm in the bad guy. No doubt.
@ChristNme violence doesn't change the past. Protest and conversation and civility will change the future
@ChristNme violence doesn't change minds, just destroys the enemy. It doesn't change people's heart
@ChristNme fair enough, you are right on that one. My bad.  But if you want a career making good $ gotta pull'em up at work.
@ChristNme MLK, Gandi, and Malcolm X did not steal shoes,TVs, and beer from their local stores to effect change...violence? No one wins
@ChristNme I did not say a thing about the shooting. Just said that looting is bad. No comparison made.
@SociologyGal all lives matter. Why would you support bullying? Stereotyping some one you do not know? I think you are better than that!
@acitrep @charlesjaco1 an open discussion is Twitter My premise that people looting is bad is still correct even though I am Southern
@acitrep @charlesjaco1 he seems to have decided I must be a right wing parody account. Good news my vote could cancel his out.
@acitrep @charlesjaco1 why would I block anybody? No reason to.
@charlesjaco1 well I guess I left out the college educated, speaks three languages, and is a very good wine judge. No parody here
@charlesjaco1 @AntonioFrench kinda makes sense, keep your pants up and don't steal other peoples stuff. What is wrong with that?
@NiagaraWBB wow folks! I guess yall gonna take the train next time?
@JimCantore @h_pierce I would start by looking in line for a house in Floridia

@TheOrangeCone @JennaFryer no winners. Pray for healing.
@khifan thanks!
@Cheers464646 all good dude! Thanks
@macklemore how's this for your atypical fan 41year old right wing alcoholic Ten months sober.My wife is surprised I pump the beats in truck
I still think that it is funny that my fraternity symbol is the same as AA.
Really cool thought. Been TEN months sober! Pretty cool. Didn't even think about till I saw an AA Billboard.
@NewsBreaker @ABC7News guns are not bad or good. People are bad

@jordan10taylor happy ending? Or did ya go to one of them fancy places?
@Espngreeny this deal reminds me of my fear. At 6'5\"310lbs I am scared of hitting anyone. Last straw in response  is violence. No excuse

@JennyJohnsonHi5 @keselowski was that your new boyfriend up on the fence?
@queers4gears I think the drunk boy was about to jump on the wagon, or the pace car
@ESPNMcGee horrible boring race. Eyes were burning. At least the drunk guy climbed the fence! Funny at least
@TheOrangeCone please!!!!
@MartySmithESPN @AdkinsTintShack i am waiting to see if you need a late yellow
@AliciaPRNradio @jayski_nascar @RIRInsider my 9yr old just saw this and said \"holy drunk idiot\"
@JennaFryer sleeping
@TheOrangeCone @DarthHendrick this is crazy both races at Richmond have basically sucked,  I can't believe a \"short track\" boring? Crazy
@DeLanaHarvick bugger eaters

@KevinHamlin @MandiHamlin no but after my wife reloaded it in front of me several times I gave up and still got in trouble
@nascarcasm @ChicagolndSpdwy we finally won a race, u think Mr H will let us sit at the big kid table with Jimmie, Jeff, and Dale
Lyphoma. Not lymphoma thank you God!!!!!!!
GOD IS GREAT! Bignin lymphoma. NOT CANCER!!!!!!! Thank you God!  I can start breathing again!
Well an hour to go. Prayers are a good thing. Hard to be a big strong rock for wife and kid while quietly terrified.
@Cheers464646 thanks Dude!
Well in 12 hours I get to find out if I just have a bump in my chest or something worse...gee this will be a great nite sleep.

@ESPNMcGee heck of a surprise
@keselowski @Motorsport well that sucks
@RyanEversley @tonydizinno way sucks!!!
@CaleConley no dress? Dude 20 years from now that dress pic will come up. Embrace it.
@CaleConley paid for  ain't it?
@WSDashBaseball best game I have seen in a while. Hate to lose close one
Ok first doc says no real worries. Playing %. Low chance for bad stuff. But ultra sound next...
@kolourco one for me!
Reading webmd not making me feel better.
Oh crap. On the way to doc office. Found a marble sized mass/lump in my chest between rib cage and skin by my nipple. Nearly panicked
@PPistone this is how u get the clap. Loose tongues and riding people
@PPistone you don't know where you got the clap?  Need to check! Go to health dept. they can give ya a shot :)
@DGodfatherMoody that was odd
@austindillon3 @CocaColaRacing yep for the 3

@chocolatemyers3 cool, will have to shine up the drop top....
@stedeangelis @P_Hampton NICE!!!
@stedeangelis @P_Hampton NICE!!!
@P_Hampton part of the reason terrorist stay off our soil. So many people carrying, never know who is. Also most who do can shoot very well
@graygaulding smooth!!!
@P_Hampton good Ronald Reagan guy that Phil, \"trust but verify\" and \"peace through superior firepower\"
@P_Hampton I may be 6'5\" 305 but these 41 year old knees aren't real stable. Don't want to carry a knife to a gun fight
@P_Hampton same here, legally carry concealed with permit every day. I travel and luckily all 4 states honor my permit.
@The_WJM dang right. Make hay while the sun is shining.
@okayCHANEL @P_Hampton I said this last night and people gave me heck over it. Nice to see
@mattdpearce that kid needs to be home! It is not a safe place to be at 11atnight
@valeriehahn @P_Hampton @LillyAFowler got robbed by little kid at a protest rally for peace? SMDH
@The_WJM @PLANETROBBY @P_Hampton maybe he is getting freakyyyy? Or just broke his phone. :)
@PLANETROBBY @WesleyLowery Michael hit the waltip supporters
@WesleyLowery bad call.Happened a few days ago and a kid got hurt. Dumb move. Parents should Read, teach, show what's going on. Not be there
@keselowski #greatracing 4 cars battling for the whole race, then a different one hits on adjustments goes low and beats them at the line
@keselowski #greatracing is any race I can watch with my son, and all drivers walk out safe. And 18 is on a wrecker
@TonyStewart take care Tony. If ya get bored DM. Prayers for all. Time helps. Getting out, quietly, will too
@lotyslove @P_Hampton through the power of RT. A middle aged white dude in VA can discuss the issues with different folks not in my location
@lotyslove @P_Hampton yep. Connects all types of folks with the unfiltered access to events. Takes your eyes to the front row
@TheOrangeCone I will support them, glad they are in the sport. Never heard of them. A win there
@Kpengell but until that change happens: if the crowds are there to protest, good, if they are looking for a fight, throwing fire bombs, bad
@Kpengell it sucks that innocent folks are getting hurt. The initial event was tragic. I hope some positive change happens out of this.
@BexaRaven @ReignOfApril I think I just got called a liberal...wow it hurts. And no, kid is at home at dark, safety is based on choices
@Kpengell think about it. Cops yelling, people yelling kill cops, media there to film it, why take a kid there? Makes no sense.
@GRASSGURU a kid can't make that call to be in a dangerous situation.. \"Let's take the kid to the riot\" is not parenting
@ReignOfApril makes no sense to take a kid to where they would be endangered.  Sporting events? Riots don't usually happen at the event
@ReignOfApril @debbietaylor58 both have a right to be there but not a smart place to take a kid. No sense endangering a child
@ReignOfApril @debbietaylor58 it is not victim blaming... It's parenting. You know there is going to be violence at a location why take kid?

@GoProMotorplex ok what the rates and hours for jr racing next week. My kid is off school and we are on the way.
@BradGillie by the storm in New Orleans. Raised tens of thousands of $.
@BradGillie the rest of the Robby story. That happen as Katrina hit Nola. E auctioned that helmet. Gave the $ to harrahs employees affected
@CopaCavanna @AllWaltrip agree
@tagliani @TeamBKR @CTMPOfficial 47mph. Also depends how much downforce it has and how fast is the critter chasing it
@PPistone the Pope does pack'em in. Let's get the The Pope-mobile to bring them fellas to the green flag! The Pope Car hitting pit road
@BobbySura04 @vanillaice dude back in the day when FSU played at WFU, we heckled you calling you V ice! Yelling and screaming, didn't help..
@SherryPollex @MartinTruex_Jr you got this!
@SherryPollex beat this. You got it! Prayers for ya!
@DGodfatherMoody well done. That was a rough call...
@jim_utter prayer Jim     You know. Grace is why we are here at all...
@ESPN_Colin @SiriusXMNASCAR Colin you listening to the best show on the radio!!!
@angieskinner5 we are all trying keep it together after hearing this.  Prayers for the family.
@PPistone ditto
@SiriusXMNASCAR @DGodfatherMoody @ESPN_Colin last one: how much money is in nascar more or less than NhL, tennis, golf?
@SiriusXMNASCAR @DGodfatherMoody @ESPN_Colin how about difference between sprint call and nascar 4cyl vs 8cly
@SiriusXMNASCAR @DGodfatherMoody @ESPN_Colin ask Colin: where do the spotters sit? Backseat? Or front seat?
@SiriusXMNASCAR @DGodfatherMoody @ESPN_Colin Colin coward will not listen to divergent opinions
@SiriusXMNASCAR preach on @DGodfatherMoody he was on the edge Monday but the last 2 days he completely lost it.
@espnradio let's go to @ESPN_Colin level. Booger eaten' Yankee, class warfare guy.
@espnradio @ESPN_Colin if you had categorized nba fans with  backward stereotypes you would have been suspended. But nascar fans-nothing
@PPistone yep.
@ESPN_Colin why not go on @SiriusXMNASCAR ??
@ESPN_Colin jackass alert!!! Colin is talking auto racing! Go back to wife beating, drug use, and game fixing refs!
@ESPN_Colin yesterday I gave you props for being respectful to racing. You completely lost it today. Why do you have to be a jackass!
@ESPN_Colin ok you lost it today!! You are an official JACKASS. GO AWAY! You don't know it leave it alone!
@PRSHD a little \"Shelby belle\" kinda like Memphis belle painting. Blonde hair with big\n\nSmile.
@chinagaomei is this exported to USA?
@shawnmottracing @ESPN_Colin agreed!
@slynnw1 @ESPN_Colin he does not. But it has not stopped most national guys from being completely wrong.
@TJNelkie nope not at all.
Wow. I have said a lot of things on twitter. Some where even pretty good, but one complement to @ESPN_Colin and my feed blows up.
@sneakeyghost @ESPN_Colin agreed on the regionalism.  Blame the south when a New Yorker and a Hoosier get in an accident.
@Zillamania @ESPN_Colin it was a rough deal. No one can tell what was in Tony's head. Hate the situation. Praying for families of all.
@sneakeyghost @ESPN_Colin true, but have u heard some of the Other national guys. Horrid options with no basis in facts
@AJPerugini @ESPN_Colin not really. has always been a part of the stigma of nascar. It is odd that he was talking about driver from Indy
@ESPN_Colin there are many espn guys that can help. @MartySmithESPN would be the best. Love to hear from him.
@MartySmithESPN horrid event sat. I wish folks could just wait on judgement. The talking heads on Fox News are killing our sport.
@FoxNews please get someone who knows racing instead of Jim gray to talk about the issues on tracks. He is WRONG!
@75RRegiment looks nice
@Just_AP glad I left beach and listened to mrn or it would be 12 before I would be home
@KeithOlbermann @NASCAR go away Keith not your sport or place. Hush
@2Spotter @WGI yep
@GottliebShow stick to basketball. You are not one to comment on this sport. Don't know difference in wedge and track bar
@dustinlong @MRNRadio what's up guys? Is this real ?
@ShannonBaxter @TonyStewart seems to be a odd turn of alleged events
@P_Hampton you seriously proud of that?  Like beating a baby seal

@PPistone nothing to do with it. The race started to late!
@PPistone tell Chad to eat a bacon burger today. Then the 48 wins the 600! It will work!
@TeamHendrick @SiriusXMNASCAR guilty too. If chad eats a bacon burger today the 48 wins the 600
@angieskinner5 vegan? Chad needs to eat a bacon burger and they will win the next race!
@jordan10taylor mullet man you need a job....idle time is as bad as losing cable. Don't catch the mafia

@JennyJohnsonHi5 @realDonaldTrump look at it this way: you are walking on hate. Jump up and down on it. Maybe a little tinkle on it too
@TheOrangeCone it is one great movie. The end of 8 seconds is pretty dad gum intense as well
@DaleJr have you ever thought about going all \"Ambrose\" on somebody? If so  what kept you from doing it?
@P_Hampton that is one dumb ass kid!! Fake crab meet?? How can he really be this stupid? Fsu pays real well, should have enough $

@Frontstretch so what do I get to do?
@Frontstretch boom I am on it!
@JennaFryer that is one hornets nest ya kicked over! I agree they have no role there. I guess you had gone too long without a troll attack:)

@TheOrangeCone @joshahamilton plus2
@RyanEversley the kid can drive!
@jim_utter @chaseelliott that kid can wheel it!
@DeLanaHarvick it never really stops. My 8yr draws full sized race cars on our drive way. And asked how to spell Budweiser
@Rusty_LaRue @kennybeckWXII dang whaa? Sorry Rusty!
@Head_Held_High she at least wasn't tated all over and fat. She protesting the unhealthy food choices? Or mc flurry with titties!
@ballardsnorth wow! I found a twitt!!
@TheOrangeCone it worked great for 475ish miles
@ariejr that don't look right
I think if we put a nascar track in the Sahara desert it would rain there!
@Varuka @NASCAR_RealTime who is varuka never heard of them. Why would they spew more hatred.I love America free speech is always allowed
@GasMonkeyGarage @RRRawlings we found a skinny monkey at @smithsonian http://t.co/dDtOX4YZwr

@PKracing30 @pkligerman @MartinsvilleSwy last one:  do you get bored driving your daily driver when are driving long trips?
@PKracing30 @pkligerman @MartinsvilleSwy if you could dump anyone on the track, who would you run out of the grove?
@PKracing30 @pkligerman @MartinsvilleSwy if you fart in the car during the race can you smell it?
@chocolatemyers3 very well done Choc!           She is the Queen of racing!
@P_Hampton @lotyslove proof you can't believe everything you see on twitter!
@KeithOlbermann on the same network for more than 6 months.
@KeithOlbermann why the hostility towards Nascar? If you are nice to folks while still getting your point across, you might stay employed
@richeisen @Nckirkpatrick crap, I have eaten there since mid 90s. Did not know.
Wow! Just sold my house! Crazy how quickly things can go. God is great! Now let's see how the offer goes on the house we want!

@JoeGibbsRacing @toyotaracing gotta be @mattkenseth !
@DennisDMZ mayor Ford in Canada ate it
@TheOrangeCone hard to see him being so filled with hate and calling himself a Christian. God decides his fate...
@ArikaHerron they had a meeting at my kids school, but really did not know what all was gonna happen
@jjyeley1 did you notice our buddy deleted his tweet yesterday?
@TheMikeBagley place needs the history, good parking, good customer service, and the potential of making history. And safety for fans
@MartySmithESPN my kid said that Daddy drinks lots of beer and fav food is wings. I gotta call from the preschool. :(

@RRRawlings hooters at 40 is good for a hooters. Barbecue at stamey's is the best in GSO across the street from coliseum for lunch
@RRRawlings dude there are a lot of cool places. Natty Greene is good. Do NOT go anywhere near coliseum to go out. Not safe. I live in WS
@P_Hampton  I agree   Kinda bs. But proves nfl is business first people 2nd.
@TeamNTS24 @TeamNTS @brennannewberry Wow!  Thanks guys!

@MikeWC77 only guy in nascar I look like is jack man for Newman last year. Big sob
@MikeWC77 @DaleJr mike you could have a ball around the clt area, could pull some fun game there.

@JennaFryer not exactly changing the chase or quals news. Glad he is focused on the big picture, but who hates random hot chick
@RyanEversley @JennaFryer not a smart thing to say. Indy folks have not done too hot in nascar. Ratings don't lie. But heck lets crank'em up
@PRSHD I agree. It took a little bit of time to get there but I do. Been dry 3 months and it has opened my eyes.
@NICKSPEED bout 4 to 6 seconds. Heard it over the tv, felt  it like a truck rumbling over speed bumbs
@NICKSPEED you Cali folks can keep this crap. Kinda scared the crap outta the wife and kid. Only the second one I have felt in 40 years
This whole earthquake thing...WTF!!! A foot of snow and now earthquake. Crap! We  felt in Winston Salem!
@RobbyGordon @TraxxasRacing @ToyoTires @SSuperTrucks @SPEED_ENERGY that's one hell of a grocery getter for snowmagddon 2014

@KatiD I was a pro at the 12oz curls but had to retire. Sorry
@2Spotter they are doing it wrong: needs bacon, bacon, bacon
@angieskinner5 panic has set it! Wonder what would happen if it actually hits? Cats and dogs sleeping 2gether! Jack Roush in a Tahoe?
My 8yr old Son just said the ballerina needs to eat a cookie, like a bag of sugar cookies!#sochi2014
@Elliott_Sadler @OneMainRacing pink shoes and gloves

@Hinchtown and to make it better I am in beckley WV away from home with 2 days of sales calls and an incoming snow storm
@Hinchtown well I hope your right, blew the transfer case in wife's truck, lost trailer brakes on mine, and laptop and iPad stolen. DONE
@JJJansen44 @geoffschwartz at least @united will respond.
@Mother_Function y'all are missing 60 degree sunshine in triad nc. First world high roller problem

@Kittykvshh_ okay the ppl in africa are not protected, they live in 3rd world countries. But hopefully they wont. And I believe they wont
@Kittykvshh_ well they cannot catch it because they will not go there exposing their skin. We are smarter than that
@Kittykvshh_ you cannot catch it by a cough. They catch it with bodily fluids.
@Kittykvshh_ right to protect the world. It is important that we stop it. Its a smart move.
@Kittykvshh_ spreading to the world and the US. The reason it is here is because it is not control. We as Americans have the humanitarian
@Kittykvshh_ well the thing is that our troops go protected, the chances of them getting ebola is small. In order for it to not keep
@Kittykvshh_ why wouldnt he?? We need to control it before it kills us here. We have the first case of ebola in the US.
Now we need the Pittsburg Pirates to slaughter the SF Giants tomorrow.

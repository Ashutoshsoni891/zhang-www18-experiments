Ok maybe I didn't say that but I was very dismissive and then felt bad but it was ok cause I used the anxiety for my scene. Acting is weird
Asking me to explain the script, and asking me what my scene is about, and all I can say is STFU I am trying to focus
I can be such a bitch sometimes.. For example when I'm on set and in the middle of an intense scene and an extra starts asking me questions
I love it when u RT me @Dassintheactor

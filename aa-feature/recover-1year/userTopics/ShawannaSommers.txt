You're stuck because you're struggling. Stop fighting and watch how fast you save yourself.
Over it. Over you.
My advice... nah you dont want that.
At this point you just want to hear yourself talk.
Solo lunching it today.
Caught in your skin.
Not sure of my next move. Maybe I am... just not sure of the outcome.
Sweet Mary.
Midday and mundane.
Matters of the heart.
You never expected this, or asked for it, but you have it and apparently earned it.
It is certain that you are both way better now for being together.
Is this a blessing or a lesson?
But every time though.

We are playing with two different decks of cards.
I'm all ears.My heart is open.
Felt good, almost healing, because the initial encounter left me feeling heavy.I treat people well. I deserve the same in return.
Today I got an apology from someone that I had an unpleasant run in with in the past. A stranger I thought I'd never see again.

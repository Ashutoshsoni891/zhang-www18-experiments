@xoxo_bekah @theturtle9214 @bongwynnn what the fuck? Who the fuck do you think you are talking to her like that? #jealousmuch #getalife
Imagine instagram told you when people screenshot your picture... I'd be screwed.
@laurin_mcc lol whatever helps you sleep at night. Good luck to you.
@krislynhunter @reIatabIe dawwww you made my dayyy. Tanks soulsista
All I know is this girl is very lucky its not my kid she playin with and she's VERY lucky I don't live close enough to my girl to help out.
If you're an enemy of someone (mutual hatred) and you post pictures of their kid, you are asking for a beat down. #grimeball #movealong
I find ir disgusting when girls try to play \"house\" with other girls children... you have to be some kinda trash to do that.
This is what Blaire does when you tell her it's time to wake up.. https://t.co/sOjcY0VVyq
Why would you follow me but deny my request to follow you? That's not crazy AT ALL.

I haven't been on twitter in foreveeeer
@krislynhunter ugh I need to do a roadtrip ASAP.
I love laying in bed cuddling my 2 babes all day 
You're not rich. Your parents are, not you. Now stop embarrassing yourself.
@DrewannMishler aw really! I was actually gonna look into something for Blaire to get involved in as well.. Gymnastics is smart!
Blaire absolutely loves curious george #mylittlemonkey
Her bodyguards  https://t.co/rtI9qNbexa
That game last night.... Still so fucking happy.
I think it's time to start tweeting again
I think it's time to start tweeting again
thanks love!!
Haven't been on Twitter in a month. Jeez I don't miss this.
The \"no eating after 6:30\" rule is kinda nice.. Didn't wake up feeling bloated from snacking at midnight.
Oh well I guess sore is better than flabby. Work should be interesting today, I can barely walk 
I have like 5 loads of laundry to do tonight ... Fack
If my nails aren't fully painted at all times I will bite them. And I hate that.
Just watched the most recent episode of total divas and I'm so happy @NatbyNature and TJ seem to be working it out  #truelove #sohappy
Decided to re-paint my nails http://t.co/xWWiTgGUaD
Wow. After just 2 solid workouts I'm already feeling better. I'm gonna stick to this like no other.
I just want my body backkkk.. but with a bigger booty  http://t.co/Ap4zZFYyYo
I just did a nice hard workout and I'm gonna do another after lunch. I'm gonna push myself so hard.

I need a gym membership... Working out in the gym is so much easier than working out at home.
@tiffanym_xo same!! 100%. Let's riot
@tiffanym_xo idk!!!! I was so disappointed they didn't have me for valentines times day this year
@twatasticalicat work  how about you love
I put strawberries, milk &amp; chocolate bfast incarnation instead of vanilla &amp; omg. It tastes like mickyds choc covered strawberry frappe 
@xtifffany your Avi pic doeee
It's suppose to be 40 degrees this Saturday... Time to break out the shorts
@xtifffany 
Or maybe because I'm a month sober.. Maybe my dreams are just fucked.
I think being on probation is making me freak the fuck out even though i haven't even done shit  I literally wake up sweating
Keep having dreams that I've smoked a blunt, did a shit ton on yay, get caught in the middle of gun fight, or am hiding out from the cops...
@JKathrine hope it goes well! Good luck girl 
@JKathrine assuming the worst. If you talk to her about it she could surprise you and totally understand. It can't hurt!
@JKathrine if you say it exactly how you're saying it to me, she won't take it personal. But i would say something instead of her just
@JKathrine 100% makes sense. Then call more! Talking on the phone is more personal anyway!
@JKathrine tell her that then! Just be open and honest. If she knows that then she might try and start convos more so you don't have to
@JKathrine and if you think she's getting too bored, just play 21 questions... Raunchy and/or personal.
@JKathrine like tell her you're not a huge texter &amp; to not take it personal. Tell her you'll talk on the phone for days but texting is hard
@mommyandhadley gotta love da bootyyyy
@mommyandhadley well thank you  but idk it use to fit better! I'm just not happy with my body right now 
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice... Need to drop about 10lbs and then I'll love this dress again. http://t.co/RbEC05lcSD
Holy shit. Just found a bag with all my favorite pre-pregnancy jeans and sweatshirts. I'm crying tears of happiness 
Ow fucking dead arm... But these wingsssss 
Alex's brother literally just tackled me to the floor until I couldn't get up  what the fuck goes on here...

@smiKAley I'm almost 24 lmao but hopefully you're lucky and it doesn't take that long for you! Everything happens for a reason 
@smiKAley ahhh I love you so much! Once you find the right guy it just happens!
He's so saaaaalty but maybe me dancing on the chair and jumping around screaming was a little sore-winnerish 
OMFG I BEAT ALEX IN TRIVIA CRACK!!!!!!
Alex is cooking me steak and potatoes for dinner  #keeper
Alex just said I was funny. It was probably the best compliment I could ask for.
When I lived on Long Island I would drink Dunkin Donuts large iced coffee for pretty much every meal... I actually miss the twitching.
The past few mornings I've put vanilla breakfast incarnation powder, milk &amp; strawberries in the blender &amp; have had that instead of coffee
Today it was 9:15 
So happy my child never really wakes up before 8. It's usually 8:30-9 
Fell right asleep in my boys arms when he got here... So comfy, so right.
@mommyash8 thank you love!! They look better after my shower hahaa
Attempted to do my own nails and even though they look like butt Alex said he loves them. Such a suck up  http://t.co/vQhdO5DsLx
Haven't had a cigg in almost 2 days.. 
@mommyash8 but I'm the \"shitty mom\" lol social media baffles me.
@mommyash8 I couldn't agree more.They also bashed me bc this 1 girl didn't like me &amp;now she's on hard drugs&amp; doesn't have custody of her kid
Abort their baby on that ask.fm shit when I never even had one..... 2 years later &amp; it still bothers me someone thinks I would say that shit
Just found the text message I got two years ago from when the moms on here \"figured me out\" apparently and accused me telling someone to
My poor widdle babe  http://t.co/5C9EermzhU
The things I'd do for taco bell right now are disgusting
I feel so so bad for her 
Blaires face is so so so swollen, bruised and her lip is so cut  I called 911 and they said to try and ice her &amp; see if the bleeding stops
Me and Alex literally went to bed so early last night. I love that he's the kind of guy that will literally cuddle me all night long.
Blaires mouth and face is so swollen.. She was running and fell and her bottom teeth practically went right through her upper lip
Ah feel so good 
Blaire is trying to play fetch with Emma but Emma refuses so Blaire has to keep chasing after the ball http://t.co/n7cvLbnVBz
Her hair was absolutely crazy the other day  http://t.co/ISfJgW50k8
@laurenspearsxo I just don't care anymore. I'm gonna wait till I'm absolutely disgusted with myself then just starve 
Fucking incredible
Girl time is the best when your life feels like shit.
Just went out to dinner with a girlfriend and Blaire... Going out with my girls just makes me realize how much I need that more in my life!
Actually just made myself a salad for lunch. Go me
Than*
It will definitely help me gain confidence and hopefully will make me happier then ever.
I've been saying this for the past few months but today is the day I'm seriously starting to eat better &amp; work out.
  #tbt #2013 #baptismpicture #priceless http://t.co/GBh6mIHaXr
Seriously so pissed off. Fuck this shit.
It's time to jump on the healthy train with him before I become an actual whale
Alex has been eating just salads for a few weeks now (minus valentines day of course) and I've been eating the usual wings, nachos &amp; fries..
@FLMAMA_ I know I melted!!
@lyssastarkey_ so glad someone agrees
Just asked blaire, \"who am I?\" And she replies, \"mine!\" 
Is that mean? Like no way in fuck I'm having another baby unless I'm married. I learned my lesson. Being a single mom is hard as fuck.
Watching girls jump from relationship to relationship and just get pregnant each time makes me love birth control.
Cuddles with the man yesterday http://t.co/qXnXPQJyq7
So I did my math wrong cause I'm a fucking idiot. Im on probation till July 28th not June 28th 
@DrewannMishler same with blaire!! It's amazing
My whole world  http://t.co/rBXRT6wiKP
SuperWhy teaches Blaire so much. It's actually crazy.
@TaGjWp oh I'm not telling him that you haven't! Then he'll think he doesn't need to! Lol
@TaGjWp omgggggawd STAWP
Alex has never seen transformers.. Not one of them. What the hell is this kid doing with his life?
So I thought I had work at 8:30am tomorrow but I actually have it at 8:30pm to serve the winsconsin mens basketball team at TEN PM. WTF
I need to print out more picture from the last year and continue doing this. I don't wanna fall too far behind and never get caught up!
My heart just melted
I just showed blaire a picture of me and her when she was just a few days old and she looks at it and points to the picture saying \"mommy!\"
Seriously need to start working out today
Thank you for being my rock and always knowing how to cheer me up and make me laugh when I need it http://t.co/bPfOB2kZL6
How am I suppose to enjoy my morning cigg with this weather? Fuck it, bundling up like a mofo http://t.co/zzh9WCOCe1
So the other day it was actually colder here than in Alaska. And that's a true statement. What the fuck
I need to be tan. Asap.
My brother said he finally got a \"six pack\"  #idiot http://t.co/7owQjp9cNO
My dad just said bye to Blaire and said \"I love you!\" And she responds back, \"Okay\" ...  that's my girl
How cute is she?!  http://t.co/ezGQ83jp7m
@mikaylamacie13 that's what I was gonna name blaire if she was a boy!!! Love that name
I made Alex the cutest/raunchiest coupon book for valentines day and he loved it so much. He kept reading them over &amp; over 
It's -10 degrees out right now. And that's not including wind chill. 
Last night around 3am me &amp; Alex randomly woke up &amp; started talking. I almost started to cry when he said to me, \"you're the love of my life\"
Had such a good valentines day 
But really doe.. http://t.co/y3tX8qaRga
Happy valentines day from me and my babeeeeee  http://t.co/klXFmOnenq
He takes me out to eat, cuddles me &amp; spoils me without any hesitation. He takes care of me &amp; blaire like it's his job. He's the real MVP.
I love my boyfriend so much. Every time someone asks him if we have plans for tomorrow he says \"everyday is valentines day\" &amp; he's right.
Haven't smoked a blunt in 4 weeks. Do you know how long that is? Only like 20 more weeks to go. 
Alex's mom and I just went to get bogies and it was probably the best car ride ever.
Little mush http://t.co/DGD849YzS7
It amazes me how much Blaire has grown. This is her 1 year checkup vs her 2 year checkup. She grew a http://t.co/Te5qn1hZ3A
Blaire at her 2 year old check up this morning  http://t.co/6hMIDM7XvM
Let's just hope I can go back to sleep and dream of happy happy things...    
And this dumb bitch was wearing my cheetah robe giving me the finger and I couldn't even form a sentence to yell at her.
What the hell is going on in my head before bed ....
Seriously though I just had a dream Alex shot people up in a theater &amp; I was really fucked up on pills rolling down the street in a recliner
Fell asleep for literally 22 minutes and had a scary fucking dream. Why
I took this picture at her 1 year old check up. I wanna try and get the same picture tomorrow. She looks so little http://t.co/5c19NoipQB
Why I thought it would be a good idea to make Blaires doctor appointment for 8:30am, I'll never understand.
Why the fuck have I been breaking out so bad. Like WHY.
I'm so lucky you're mine  http://t.co/Xva7FtviqK
Thank god me &amp; Alex have the same idea for our wedding cake  http://t.co/dLlj88qFMV
Blaire just ate an entire carton of blueberries by herself 
Pretty sure Blaire has outgrown her little pink car  my little girl is growing up too fast! http://t.co/w0e52HITri
She refuses to look at the camera for me.. she just continues looking down and smiling #littleboob http://t.co/y0tplE6yZk
Waking up* ... Idiot.
Me and Blaire are just now waking to... It's 10:15 
She literally sleeps on my face constantly  http://t.co/TqYbl6bd00
@LauraM615 amen sistaaa
@LauraM615 I have the book! I never got a chance to read it but now that I've seen the movie I must read it! The books are always better!!

@vonchisLa dudddde I had a night class at NCC and I didn't get out till 10 and it was so scary walking to my damn car!! Be careful 
Safe Haven was seriously SUCH a good movie
Watchinf safe haven with the boo
Feel like absolute shit 
Jesus my head is gonna fall off
WHO CARESSSSSS JESUS CHRIST
STOP SHOUTING OUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE 2K FOLLOWERS!!! STOPPPPPP
@FLMAMA_  right!! I love it!
Can't wait to see my boy later 
Whenever Blaire is quiet in another room I'm always like uh oh.. But whenever I go in she's always, always reading.
Confidence is key
@tiffanym_xo well they deff started out on the wrong foot. That's no way to make friends with your neighbor!! You tell em girl 
@tiffanym_xo holy shit!!! Have you ever said something to them?! I would be all over that shit haha
@tiffanym_xo I would kill them! Why they would flick them in your yard and not theirs or put a damn ash tray out is beyond me.
@tiffanym_xo this is why I love not having neighbors... And why I flush the butts of my ciggs.

9am and my mom has already started.. \"Well I'm taking you off my insurance, good luck\"... \"I'm taking you off the phone family plan\".. STFU

Finally finishing work. Now heading home to blow up balloons and filling the room up with them so blaire wakes up happy 
Guess my brother hasn't been on my Instagram in a while cause he just liked 31 pictures of blaire
@beauutifulmess_ 
Wow good tweet Rachel
Love how Alex's mom joins for a cigg in the mornings 
I CANNOT BELIEVE I WILL BE THE MOTHER OF A 2 YEAR OLD TOMORROW  http://t.co/BZU3Znei4o
Alex is doing the crossword in the paper and me &amp; his dad are playing trivia crack together on the couch.. He thinks I'm so smart 
Bogie in his backyard sooo nice and relaxing http://t.co/FM1tboAbnR

@beauutifulmess_ I have no idea! Hahaha yay that's so exciting! 
@beauutifulmess_ no way!!! 
Did I really just start crying during shrek the third.... What the hell
Enjoying my morning coffee &amp; cigg in my peaceful backyard  http://t.co/Xg1o7eNuI6
Blaire just brought nail polish over to me &amp; made me paint her toe nails 
@mommyandhadley @krislynhunter 
@krislynhunter hahaha I'm texting you! 
@krislynhunter yeah last week I did. Dude it was intense
@krislynhunter you can talk to me 
Well I tracked down a picture of Blaires \"dads\" niece. Anyone else see a resemblance? http://t.co/MOw4k4D6xr
Blaire Annabelle &amp; Emma Lou  #wcw http://t.co/6Z3vF6r6UE
I get way too competitive with trivia crack..
Such a monkey  http://t.co/fpcEFEbkrL
Just scrubbed the fuck out of the bathroom in anger. I need a cigg.
@brieemuccie guess everyone agrees 
@TaGjWp omg I bet!! I can't even imagine blaire being 5!
@TaGjWp right?! I can't believe it myself!
My mom just hates the fact that I'm happy. I'll never understand her.
Alex taught Blaire how to have a pillow fight yesterday so now she keeps running around with her pillow screaming &amp; hitting me and the dog
My mom is seriously the most miserable human being I've ever met. If you're happy, don't go around her.. She will literally ruin that.
I'll be much happier when spring starts to make an appearance.
Blaire will be 2 on Saturday 
Jail food is worse than people say it is  48 hours was more than enough time to figure that out.
Trivia crack is literally addicting.
Alex got me a new phone screen and a pink charger 
Eating a cookie and watching netflix on her kindle while relaxing in her recliner #thelife http://t.co/4RXHTsKDCC
Well it paid daycare for the week!
But, on the bright side.. Alex's mom paid me $60 for cleaning his brothers room so well  I refused about 6x but she insisted 
My phone is basically completely broken and haven't been able to use it 
Being squeezed in the middle of this twin bed with both babes is probably the best feeling in the world. So much love surrounding me. 
Alex and my dog are knocked the fuck out in my bed while me and blaire are laying on the floor  bed hogs
The next 2 days are gonna be hell. Can't it be Wednesday already?
My little lady  http://t.co/CKkPEK2Ngj
Now the 3 of us are out for a nice dinner 
Oh, plus my boxer.
Me, Alex &amp; blaire took a 4 hour nap today together... In a twin size bed
Oh shit this night oh no
@stone_valerie EXCUSE ME!!! HOW!
Alex literally takes the best care of me. Never ever makes me pay for anything. He even pays for daycare and my tickets when I need help
Ugh at work and feel so sick. 
@mommyandhadley oh Jesus Christ no way in fuck I'm pregnant hahaha and I won't be until you see a ring! 
Just cleaned Alex's brothers room and after 2 garbage bags of beer cans, 1 huge bag of garbage and running the vacuum it looks fantastic 
@xoxo_bekah both 
Bothering Alex before 9am is my speciality 
@mrgozinya15 jesusssss, idk how you do it!
@mommyandhadley what? Lol
Idk why all you moms care so much about each others parenting. You don't even know each other in real life. Take a chill pill.
Blaire has her first freckle! 
Dropped my phone on the ground during the night and the screen is all fucked up.... More than it already was 
Had a dream I was so late to court today 
I'm actually honored
Alex just called &amp; was SO happy because his brother told him \"I like Rachel, she's pretty awesome\" and his brother never likes his gfs
Breakfast for dinner 
I'm so blah. I just wanna lay in bed and cry for no reason.
Ugh
@TheeCodyRay I respect your opinion tho
@TheeCodyRay well bullying makes no one better. I can't say anymore than that before I start getting shit from everyone.
@BRiT_MARiExo11 seriously!!!
People take twitter WAAAAAY too seriously. Calm down people this app will be gone before you know it.
@TheeCodyRay maybe once. Not by everyone on twitter. Pretty sure we've all fucked up here or there. It was a TWEET. People need to chill.
Got 3 of hours of sleep.. Got to work at 6:30 just to find out my breakfast is cancelled and I'm only worked lunch. FUCKK MY LIFE.
I slept on Alex's shoulder from the min. we left his driveway to the minute we pulled into mine. That's a good 25 min drive. Now I'm awake
Save your pity party for someone who cares 
I'm so cold I can feel my heart dying
Here is a blurry picture of Blaire smothering Emma. Poor pup. http://t.co/x3I0WKPTmB
I need to get off twitter before I explode.
If you're not getting followers on your own, that's your fault. No one likes beggers.
Why do people need to gain followers from others? Can't you be good enough on your own?
So pathetic  y'all are stupid.
EYEBROWS! People are worried about eyebrows! Like is this our biggest problem!?
If you judge people on their eyebrows, that says more about YOU than them.
I don't care what society thinks... Some girls look HORRIBLE with thick eyebrows. You either pull it off or you don't.
@krislynhunter #thestruggle 
Do I look like cinderfuckingella to you? Do your own dirty work.
@krislynhunter me everyday
@krislynhunter lmaoooo people think I'm Blaires older sister half the time, sooooo chu know how it is 
YAY Alex is out of work 
@itsaceleBREtion me too girl!! 
@itsaceleBREtion you seem like the best girlfriend and mother. I'm so happy I get to interact with you on here.. For years now 
Everyone has different opinions about EVERYTHING. Bullying someone because you believe something different is just stupid. Just stop.
This world is such a cruel cruel place. I feel bad for my child.
@BornCountry_ @TheeCodyRay bullying someone makes you no better.
@krislynhunter if only I was a teen mom lol
@emzily1 I don't know you personally but don't listen to all these people. You're beautiful and one TWEET doesn't define you.
@krislynhunter hahaha you're right, I would! But I'm only like 2.5 years older! Stop making me feel OLD 
@krislynhunter hahaha I'm 23 you ass that's not that much older!! When do you turn 22?!
@krislynhunter 
@krislynhunter lmao what are you 14 you wittle babyyyy
Messy toy room = Happy child http://t.co/tH1cohuzg1
@twatasticalicat text me tomorrow pwease!!

@xtifffany I knew I remembered that!! Haha yay for Pisces 
@xtifffany 6th! Why do I have a feeling yours is on the 17th?! Tell me I'm right!
Wait.. I'll be 24 in March. What the FUCK.
I could be saving a liter of puppies and my mom would still find a reason to be mad at me. #ridiculous
She's mad at me because I put her in a onesi &amp; she couldn't play with her belly button... But, of http://t.co/WBW4R8PCZg
I would kill to be a Total Diva
I napped for about a half hour and I swear I controlled everything in my dream because I knew I was dreaming....\n\nIs that weird?
Now nap time for the babe &amp; maybe a little one for me 
Got ALL my calls done &amp; filled out my application for BioLife 
@xoxo_bekah well 3 of them had me on hold and I hung up after like 5 minutes and tried calling back and it went to voicemail lol
I've made 5 phone calls so far and have gotten 4 answering machines. It's Monday, aren't people suppose to be working?!
So many phone calls to make today 
Woke up feeling sore... I'm actually excited to workout again today. 
Everyone keeps telling me to cut Blaires hair.... Go worry about your own damn hair.
I just saw 3 people shout out the same mom who already has over 30k followers. I had to unfollow her &amp; everyone shouting her out. #annoying
It reealllly reeeeeally bothers me to see people doing shout outs on Instagram. Like WHY?! Seriously WHY?! 27k followers isn't enough?!?!
On the phone with Alex and we just agreed next date day were building a fort 
I've been doing push-ups and planks during every commercial and I literally feel better already
The blind side makes me cry every single time
Of course gas is the lowest when I don't have my car 
Blaire and Alex seriously save me when I'm about to lose my mind. I'd be so lost without them 
Snow Snow Snowwww
Trying to find an apartment knowing I won't have a car for the next 6 months is too stressful. I'm so overwhelmed.
Trying to figure out your future is so hard 
Facing my fear of opening mail and getting my life back on track. Today will be a day of organizing and getting shit done. 
Alex is making me a grilled cheese.. I'm literally gonna devour it. I could eat like 7 right now.
Ignoring the camera is her new thing  http://t.co/5W7taeF82g
Jesus fucking Christ finally...shit
I'm about to lose it
Baby is on a little road trip with grandma today so I got this cute picture sent to me  http://t.co/d7q2YsXhJU

Boyfriend went to bed by 8:30 last night and it's 11 now... He's going on 15 hours... HOW can he sleep like this?!

Blaire and my mom are taking a little road trip today to see my aunt &amp; of course I can't go because I have work..
@King_Queenshit wrong shit yet again. The girls pathetic.
@King_Queenshit thanks mama!! And type in the real jenelle evans on YouTube there's 2 videos. No brawl just her running her mouth about the
@kmarie92709 omg I found it. It's ridiculous. The girl is STILL a fucking mess. She needs a good slap
Found that video of @PBandJenelley_1 on YouTube from her most recent vacation.... What a disgrace.
What's the video called on YouTube of JE bashing people in the service?
What's the video called on YouTube of JE bashing people in the service?

@kelsey_bahner please do!!! 
@kelsey_bahner be my parent plus Blaires. And my mom is just SO mean to me it's crazy. Like it's so obvious and embarrassing.
@kelsey_bahner I bet. I have lived w her forever besides when I was away at school. But I live w my grandma and my mom and they both try and
@kelsey_bahner really? I'm trying but it's so hard especially cause I don't have a car right now
This guy on the price of right is killin' it right now holy shiz
Pretzels dipped in cream cheese is the shhhhhhit
In less than a month, this little monster will be 2 years old  http://t.co/3T7aAZ1WMR
Otherwise 
My daughter is such an angel... \n\nWhen she's sleeping 
My stomach has hurt so bad the past week. What the fuck
@meghanduby_ so wAs mine!! She all of a sudden tries to kick our boxer and I'm like wtf?! That's your best friend!! Lol
@meghanduby_ um if our daughters were friends we would literally be in so much trouble
@xtifffany  preeeeeach
Oh no, all of @PBandJenelley_1 groupies are trying to bash me. Let me go cry now  #idiots
@xtifffany lmao dude I could see you killing her 
I love when people try standing up for JE but can't even spell her name right  y'all are as dumb as she is.
If you support/like @PBandJenelley_1 please tell me now so I can unfollow you 
So dark but kisses from my girl  #wcw #mommysgirl http://t.co/kcyCxkjtOR
I've never even heard tswifts version of this but I'm obsessed with theirs.. \n\nhttp://t.co/lHmsi2j97N
Can't wait to see my boy tonight. I need cuddles and blunts 
I would seriously love for everyone to take 5 minutes and read this. It's amazing. \n\nhttp://t.co/y9rPH1QjGZ
Fell asleep putting Blaire to bed and I woke up thinking it was like 6am but it was actually only 11:30. What the fuck
Seriously kisses from my baby have to be the best thing ever. The kisses aren't forced &amp; I don't have to tell her to do them. She just does
Laying in bed and blaire keeps giving me the BEST kisses. I'm dying
@JC02 I will be.. Thanks
Need to fucking move out ASAP. My mom mentally abuses me and I'm officially done with it. Fuck this shit.
I love how Ross walks Carol down the aisle 
And yes, wine &amp; everything bagels go really well together.
An everything bagel, a few glasses of wine, friends on netflix &amp; folding laundry... All while blaire unfolds it. #perfect
@brieemuccie I literally was listening to this the other day and tweeted about it hahahah soul sista
Boyfriend is STILL not awake. Is this real life?
I do a million things around the house before he even moves from his coma.
I don't understand how my boyfriend can sleep for 12-13 hours every night. I mean yeah, sounds nice until you waste the whole day..
I need to dye my hair &amp; get a trim so badly.
@ryancedwards wait, that's not normal?
@brieemuccie that's when the bowl becomes my best friend.
@King_Queenshit JUST WATCHED THIS ONE
@meghanduby_ lol right!!?
Or nah
@mamaearthly if you're referring to friends me and my boyfriend watched this episode yesterday!!! Haha love that they named him ben 
@peeeaches 
I look uglier in this picture than I remember 
Alex just slapped me in the face with a bag of bud 
YAY found it
My baeritto  http://t.co/K4Gfctvhyj
Me and Alex took the cutest picture at the holiday party and of course I managed to lose it  hopefully it's in the car
B L U N T
30 degrees has never felt so good
I wish if someone didn't answer FaceTime you could leave them a video message instead... like a voicemail.
@JC02 lol not even. Just excited.
But Blaire is sleeping on my shoulder and I'm enjoying it too much
Literally pumped to smoke a few bowls right now
Selfie from earlier  http://t.co/4yCgieV4h9
Just stubbed my toe so I was obviously on the ground in pain and blaire came over and kissed it 
@FL_MILF so do I!! Hahahah
Alex's mom and blaire got along so well, she even asked to babysit her one night! His mom's just the best.
Love how Alex always sends me home with bud when I don't have any left 
@King_Queenshit it's so nice! Thank you gorgeous 
Laughing at Alex  http://t.co/ZEGInZUwTx
She's so comfortable with him today... Ugh this is perfect
Watching Alex play with Blaire and tickle her makes me seriously melt 
Like being a passenger in her car makes me wanna take the fucking bus. I would get places faster.
My mothers driving is seriously my number 1 trigger to anxiety. She's one of those drivers I HATE driving behind or worse, being a passenger
Blaire looks so cute for dinner tonight  I even got her earrings back in!
Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.
@TaGjWp  thank you pretty!!!! You're too kind!
Really hope me and alex get a nice picture together tomorrow at the party.. Highly unlikely tho cause we will both forget then be too drunk
Why people tweet people their standing right next to I'll never understand.
@mommyandhadley well thanks mama 
@xoxo_bekah ahhhh thanks lovey, you're the best 
@mommyandhadley ahhhh thank you! I've gained weight recently so I'm like so nervous haha but thanks for boosting my confidence pretty!
Feel like a whale... Debating on wearing this to my holiday party but idk http://t.co/Bw22W6wYaa
I'm so fat now a days. How the hell am i suppose to wear a dress to my works holiday party tomorrow.
Kinda nervous for Alex's family dinner tonight. Blaire gets so shy 
Dinner with babe http://t.co/tJHGYwePKW
@tagxo16 seriously hahahah
@laurenspearsxo well it's deff not a problem!! Haha
Literally told Alex twice to bring my boots.. Once an hour before, once 15 minutes.... Guess what he forgot?! 
Nap buddies http://t.co/BWDs5sVn77
Shoveled, vacuumed, did laundry, did the dishes &amp; put all Blaires old clothes away... And you tried to tell me weed makes you lazy 
Blaire always points at things and says \"ew\" 
I love how all the friends episodes are titled \"the one with the...\"
@peeeaches hahaha same 
@peeeaches I'm pretty much always eating but I refuse to get that big  I'll start my diet in like a week or so..
@v3ntoxo that's my girl, fucking up girls dreams just by a tweet.
@King_Queenshit better not shut me out! 
So nice to have a big porch with a roof over it &amp; no neighbors.
@v3ntoxo and that's why I love you
Ruffles and French onion dip are my weakness.
She posed and said \"cheeese\"  my little diva #blowinupinsta http://t.co/Fch04CpZgh
Listening to Ciara pandora to change it up a little bit &amp; I can't believe I forgot about all these good songs
Let Me Hold You by Bow Wow and Omarion will always get to me
Wild child  http://t.co/SQYBLfSyhV
Blaire insists on brushing her teeth about 7x a day... Literally
Big load of laundry to do http://t.co/TYAIR06fTS
All this snow makes me wanna smoke a few blunts, cuddle in bed with both my babes and watch some netflix.
People ask me, \"it's -5 out, is that bogie really worth it?\".... Yes, yes it is.
Alex &amp; his mom invited me and Blaire to family dinner tomorrow... I hope Blaire decides to eat something besides ketchup! 
Woke up to a shit ton of snow 
Blaire has been holding my hand every time she fell asleep this week. It's so cute. http://t.co/Gi6xXjqi3v
Out to lunch with the boy 
I've got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin dooooo
If you constantly lie about little things &amp; don't think I'm worth the truth than I'm out. I don't deserve to be treated like a fucking fool.
People lie about the LITTLEST things. No wonder I can't trust fucking anybody.
@TaGjWp that's awesome, more power to ya!! I'll deff enjoy a few for you!
@TaGjWp tell me about it  I didn't have any yesterday haha I smoked a parliament  luckily I just got a pack so I'm about to be in heaven!
I need a marlboro menthol 100 smooth pronto.
@YoungMomIssues holy hell!!!
3 degrees out. With wind chill, -15. \n\nIs this real life?
Passed out early last night &amp; so did my boyfriend and he just called me at 2:50am because he woke up &amp; wanted to tell me he loves me 
@RoDeLano omg how exciting!!  congrats!!
@RoDeLano good luck love!!!
Why can't fingernail polish stay on as long as toenail polish does?
@kelsey_bahner I love you suga!
Alex always calls me \"bae\" and I always respond with \"bacon and eggs?\"  he hates me
@King_Queenshit lol not yet!
@King_Queenshit every time someone says canada I always think of degrassi right away 
@King_Queenshit holy shit that's not okay
Can season 3 of OITNB just be done already?
@v3ntoxo  it's an everyday thing haha
I really wonder what some people would do without their parents/boyfriends money...
It's 7 degrees outside
I think I'm done with mad elf for the season 
I still feel like asshole though, what the hell.
Alex doesn't even smoke cigs so it's probably an old pack but I honestly couldn't care less.
Thank God I took a bogie from Alex this morning and saved it all day or I would be pissed to not have it tonight.
After a 3 hour nap with Blaire, guess what?\n\nI STILL FEEL LIKE SHIT
My fucking head 
Blaire just dumped out her Legos and it was so loud I think my ears are bleeding 
Coach Carter is on 
Stouffers macaroni and cheese doe 
Fuck yeah found chicken nuggets in the freezer downstairs 
That'll do
Is that how you spell em? 
Well I found macaroni and cheese &amp; pierogues
I need like chicken nuggets &amp; fries or something
If I sneeze, blaire pretends to sneeze. If I cough, blaire will cough. If I laugh, she laughs or just pretends to make a laughing face 
My chef told me he's gonna get me to dance... He better know he's getting me a bunch of drinks before that'll ever happen.
Last year at my works holiday party I won a kindle fire.. I hope I win something again this year 
Wow, it's literally freezing outside
HAHA she just points to mr. noodle on Sesame Street and goes \"EW\" 
Sometimes I forget my baby won't be little forever.
Is it nap time yet? 
I think I will deff die if blaire throws a fit over something though  I'll probably just cry with her.
4 hits deep &amp; the tv doesn't seem to be as bright or as loud\n\nThank the fucking Lord
4 hits deep &amp; the tv doesn't seem to be as bright or as loud\n\nThank the fucking Lord
@Itsbriiiiiiii  thanks gorgeoussss
Well that hit encouraged me to throw up. 
Am I really using matches to light the bowl. This is gonna take all day. Where the fuck's my lighter.
I can't function.
1 month from today I will be the mother of a 2 year old
@krislynhunter ciggs 
Hangovers shouldn't exist.
My cuddle bug http://t.co/wKMF545TAa
Lost a full pack of bogies last night. SICK
@AlyssaHelm true statement! Haha
Started off the night with a Long Island &amp; 3 mad elfs probably wasn't too smart.
This bowl better cure me.
Honestly this hangover is the worst one I've had in so long.
But first, lemme take a selfie http://t.co/HKvHfQB485
@AlyssaHelm fucking miss you too. Out with Britney for drinks haha
Or 8

Da fuck
Blaire refuses to walk in the snow 
Kind of wish @F1abraham was still gonna be on teen mom when it returns. She always made me feel better about myself..
Not only is @MaciBookoutMTV pregnant, but it's a GIRL!  I'm so excited for her 
Ummmmm no. GTFO
Didn't know it was suppose to snow today? Woke up to everything being covereddddd
SICK BRUH
Friends on netflix? Season 1 Episode 1 so pumped
After this bogie..
Only way I can expect a better year is if I make it one.. Time to change some shit up
Mmmmm bacon
My new header makes Blaire look like an angry little diva 
White cheddar cheez-itssss 
@Urban_Chick1990 that's awesome! Congrats

MACI IS PREGNANT!? SHUT THE FUCK UP
Someone looks real happy  http://t.co/pJQjvo9v4X
Chicken fajitas, tater tots &amp; salad. Dinner of champions.
Kinda like when Blaire doesn't nap all day... Bedtime then becomes 7:45-8 &amp; who can complain about that?
When Blaire is in high school &amp; tries to steal my liquor, she better expect me to empty them myself &amp; put water in there before she does
I refuse to give up bacon cheeseburgers, pizza, nachos &amp; beer. Unless it's a buffalo chicken salad, you can keep it for yourself.
I think I'm gonna actually try and work out tonight .. Found some fitness shit on this roku. Might as well stop bitchin and make some movess
Someone give me some quick, simple ways to lose weight.. And don't say cut out bad food cause I won't. Should I just workout orrrrr
@mommyandhadley 
@krislynhunter @RealStonedPanda  IDFWU
Why do I feel like brining my wii to Alex's to keep there for a while is a big deal? Probably cause now I won't have Mario kart in my room..
Excited for babe to clean my bowl. This is loooooong overdue. Although I thoroughly enjoy the like 3 years of resin I got in there..
@krislynhunter crazy women are the best! 
@krislynhunter me neither &amp; I love it that way  let's give em something to talk aboutttt
@krislynhunter they obviously have nothing exciting going for them
I wish I didn't love food so fucking much
@krislynhunter lol mad people stay concerned about your relationship 
@xtifffany lmao I got like 5 pieces together &amp; I just can't do it 
Seriously so excited to see American Sniper when it comes out with my boy.
@brieemuccie yesss!! Sounds perfect
@brieemuccie awe I don't blame you!! If you ever need someone to talk to, you know I'm alwaaaays here.. &amp; you have my number still right!? 
The wind today is outta control
lol WAH
@brieemuccie why did I have no idea he was in the army!!
@BluntedBitchCT you're literally such a babe 
Let the subtweets begin 
Go bitch about car seats, boob/bottle, or shitty parents somewhere you can make a difference. You make no difference on twitter. Seriously.
You all point ya damn dirty fingers but truth be told if you were perfect parents you wouldn't be on social media bitching about other moms
You moms worry too much about other moms. Mind ya own damn mom business. Even if you are a parent, you have no room to judge other parents.
As I struggle to put this together, Blaire decides to make a mess for me to clean up after just in case I get bored http://t.co/nYyaGT6pWV
@mommyandhadley Wait you got her an easel too!? Why is this like rocket science lmao
@krislynhunter it actually is! I'm getting use to it!
Seriously the directions for this easel are way too complicated. I'm halfway done and completely stuck on what to do next 
Getting baked &amp; putting together this easel today... Should be interesting http://t.co/GNCPvoNw8Y
9:05 Blaire woke up today 
@krislynhunter ms.. Plus you can go on twitter, fb etc and you can bring it to anyone's house it'll connect to their wifi. It's pretty cool
@krislynhunter I like the bratz makeup better lmao
Holy shit just watched Tyler Perry's Temptation and it was so fucking good
@jdep9 oh facccck
@jdep9 gracias love!
Is safe haven a good movie?
@meghanduby_ hahah sorry! I love sunny d
Well said that 2 minutes too early. The ending was not.
\"The Pill\" on Netflix was a lot better than I thought it would be
Love the roku. I can watch Netflix on my tv &amp; just plug my headphones into the remote and now blaire won't wake up from the noise 
My phones bugging out and deleting shit. It's even making the space bar look like I'm hitting it but I'm not  scary
Alex's mom says the nicest things to me. We gossip over coffee and bogies. She always tells me \"I'm so happy you're with my ally!\" 
I would rather look like a bratz doll than a Barbie any day.
You guys really think a bunch of twitter moms are gonna make her turn her life around? Her own baby girl can't even do that.. Give up.
Even him just picking up a gallon of milk for her makes me melt. I'm just so not used to this.
Not only does Alex spoil me but he also makes sure Blaire has everything she needs too. It's just so amazing I can call him mine.
Thank god I left the milk in Alex's car bc when I went to call him I realized I forgot my phone too luckily he realized &amp; came back #idiot
So happy to have my man home 
Hot OG shop.. Fries, subs and beer.\n\nIn all honestly it looks better saying OG than dog. http://t.co/9SN2Al481s
Ummmm this car has Sirius radio. Fuck it I'm keeping this bitch
I wonder if you're allowed to smoke blunts in rental cars... Well, too late to care now
This rental car is siccccck. In love 
YAY TIME TO GET READY TO PICK UP MY BOY
@Jenn_Mc21 it's a scary time!! It gets better but I feel like I'll ALWAYS be scared of failing and maybe that's how every mother feels
@Jenn_Mc21 you're going to be fantastic, don't worry love!!
@Jenn_Mc21 it still scares me! I never know if I'm doing shit right but seeing how how happy blaire is everyday makes those thoughts go away
I'M SO EXCITED FOR TOMORROW I CAN'T SLEEP 
The past few nights Blaire has held my hand while falling asleep. It makes me melt e v e r y single time
http://t.co/yrvCGKI5yK
I drink a ridiculous amount of crapple.
Did my nails so I don't look completely ratchet tomorrow http://t.co/ImEDiSu5ky
My mother is the definition of psycho.
It's a must to wear 30 bracelets everyday. #diva http://t.co/U3f7tdsUdO
@mamatodoublers \"by Felicia\" oh
@mamatodoublers you can't go off on someone if your grammar is that bad. She's so embarrassing 
If you're American in the living room, what are you in the bathroom?\n\nEuropean 
24 hours from now I'll be on my way to get my boy. I am beyond excited 
I asked Blaire to point to my nose so she smiles and sticks her entire finger up it. Thanks darling.
Honestly, these dreams have GOT TO GO.
Bruh
@kelsrenee01 hell yeah!! 
@kelsrenee01 yup that's awesome!  blaire was cranky over ONE and that was that haha
@kelsrenee01 isn't that the best!? Haha
Blaire did fucking awesome with teething. I never knew she had a tooth coming in cause it didn't phase her at all. She has like 18 teeth now
No
@assandbows um I'd be honored!
If I actually knew and saw the people who are on my TL everyday out on the street, I'd probably hug 50% of them and punt the other 50%. 
Let her ruin her life, who cares. #karmaatitsfinest
@King_Queenshit same! Just cause I can bitch on here and get all the random thoughts I think about out of my head 
I'm a loser.
I like posting pictures of Blaire but I don't like just sit there scrolling through everyone else's all day anymore.
That week I didn't have my phone made me realize how I really don't like Instagram that much anymore. I'm kinda over it 
Feel so much better  thank you mary.
Since my phone is synced with Alex's apple shit, he gets all the texts I receive and send out on his phone so he can read all my convos 
Blaires knocked out. Might as well smoke some bowls &amp; call it a night
Wtf why do I have a stomachache
#facts http://t.co/Va8CGIMWfY
How sweet is he?  idiot. http://t.co/i2z1EytQvv
Bundling the baby up &amp; going for a nice walk.
Blaire loves to play with her hello kitty ball. I've tried teaching her how to catch it but it wasn't happening. So now we play fetch.
There were 3 of us without our bf/gf last night &amp; before my friend lex kissed her man she looks over at us, points &amp; goes \"fucking losers!\"
I just ate 2 everything bagels. My diet seems to be going swell.
I just ate 2 everything bagels. My diet seems to be going swell.
Blaire never gets sick. Ever. But today, she has a runny nose, cough and is super clingy. Seems like a perfect day to stay in pjs &amp; cuddle
Literally gonna tackle him when I see him step off the plane and just smother him in kisses
I CANT WAIT FOR MY BOY TO COME HOMEEEEEEEE.
fuck you too
Fuck I'm in such a depressed mood

Blaire just pulled down her pants and goes \"look, poops\" 
Car, hotel &amp; bud situation all ready for the weekend  look at me, not procrastinating and shittttt
So since I work in banquets in a place owned by Marriott, I get 2 free nights at any Marriott hotel.. Guess I'm using 1 this weekend 
Blaire is making sure Emma's ears don't get cold today... With mommy's headband of course. http://t.co/Rk8mxdSN4T

Can't wait to FaceTime Alex later
Soooooo excited to pick up my man in Pittsburgh on Saturday  #3moredays
Woke up to Blaire kissing my back this morning  it was too cute
New robe selfie  http://t.co/f5f3G5Zcmo
Don't even feel like going out for New Years since my boy is away  I think some wine &amp; some bowls after the babes in bed will be my night.
Really regretting totaling my car right about now though
My friends renting the car for me  ugh I have the best friends ever.
Well that 8th went real quick..
@ash_7_ hahahaha yeah I gotta ask him again 
@ash_7_ yeah fuck that I'll find a friend to help a bitch out  &amp; tbh i can't remember if it's philly or Pittsburgh airport to pick up my bf
@ash_7_ oh I have the money but I don't have a credit card

Snaps while baby is asleep http://t.co/1id7uWrqdm
How old do you have to be to rent a car for a night
Shit
Red lobster was delicious but I'm about ready to throw up any second now
Okay the Christmas music can go..
Time to get my ass off twitter &amp; change to netflix 
On tonight's menu, it's a box of cheez-it snack mix 
My favorite is the container of chocolate frosting

IDFWU
Fuck off

She's tagged me in 13 of them and has no intention on stopping.  bowls and laughs were deff what I needed 
Told my friend I was having an iffy night &amp; she starts tagging me in the funniest shit  this is why I love her. http://t.co/2ZoSQ4fvbV

Bedtime bowl 
I wish I could take all my girls from Long Island and move them next door to me 
Baby grind on me, relax ya mind, take ya time on me
That's cool too..
Thinking of going for a walk to try &amp; de-stress. Walking &amp; music usually do the trick 
@King_Queenshit mines away so I figured it was the perfect time to start!!  great minds think alike
Season 1 Episode 1 of Gilmore girls. \n\nThank you Netflix.
@krislynhunter I can't wait till I don't have any poopy diapers to change!! Omgggg

@seeeestone that would be perfect 
@seeeestone well after b, I'm probably gonna make something to eat because by then I'll think food is more vital. Hahahah the struggle.
I choose b.
Blaire is napping. I can either a) nap with her or b) roll a blunt. \n\nThis is the most difficult decision all day.
@krislynhunter OMFG ME ME ME
Cleaning out Blaires drawers and putting all her new clothes in... How does she grow so fast?!
Poor Emma http://t.co/YVVAU9SjzH
Making sure Emma stays warm.. http://t.co/JhQRc5S3ur
She's in love with her Christmas present from grandpa  http://t.co/Cp5QeVVVKV
Blaire officially tells me when she's going \"poopy\"and \"peeps\"... I think it's time to break out the potty 
http://t.co/Miwgow1TKg
Whenever my boxer is sleeping, Blaire always makes it a point to stick her little fingers up Emma's nose and pull at her eyelids 
Blaire watches my old Barney tapes on VHS. I find that pretty cool.
Is it time for Alex to come home yet?
@King_Queenshit  at least I'm doin' something right!
@ash_7_ best compliment 2014 thank you very much
@ash_7_ oh dontchu worry 
@ash_7_ and what if I am hahaha
Whenever I start singing, Blaire points at me going \"Noooo! Noooo!\".... How embarrassing 
We'd make love then we'd fuck and then you'd give me my spaceeeee
If I had it my way I'd roll outta bed say bout 2:30 mid-day hit the blunt then hit you up to come over to my place you'd show up right away
@ash_7_ 
Getting smoke in your eye is just the worst.
Sleeping naked is so comfy
Packed a bowl before bed &amp; fell asleep before smoking it. What a nice treat to wake up to
Yesssss my child is the BEST. We're just waking up  damn, 9am never looked so good.
It's just crazy how smart she is. She sits back and observes something twice and bam, she's a wiz.
Blaire has me read her the same FOURTEEN stories every single night, in the same exact order. Luckily a lot of them are short 
She's actually slept till 9-9:15 the past 4 days. It's been unreal.
Blaire woke up at 9 and has been awake since. It's about to be story time and go back to bed but going to bed later could mean sleeping in
Time to roll up a blunt and have some quiet mommy time 
Blaire didn't nap all day so she's literally knocked out right now 
So happy blaire decided to like her grandparents this time.
@krislynhunter that hashtag fits up perfectly 
@krislynhunter exactly! I wonder how many people think of my name like that 
@krislynhunter some cunt back on Long Island. Lol just saw a picture of her and it literally irked me.
You piece of shit. Fuck you.
My little girl looking like a little boy  http://t.co/pkC3JgztzO
I never thought I could hate someone as much as I fucking hate you.
I think you're allowed to be annoying if you can admit you're annoying.
Alex just texted me saying he misses me and he left this morning.... This is gonna be a lonnnnnnnng week #comebacknow
Found a nice little 8th to pick up tonight... Thank The Lord.
@krislynhunter we would literally be best friends! And so would our babies  I'm tempted to make this happen
@krislynhunter well I try!! 
Blaire got a whole new wardrobe for Christmas and I'm not gonna lie I'm pretty jealous.. She looks fabulous.
@TaGjWp ahhh thank you so much!! That means a lot! I'm very happy!
@TaGjWp 
I guess you can call me that annoying girl who brags about her boyfriend on twitter all day.... Doesn't offend me.
Made Alex a going away bag for the car/plane. Filled it with blunts, joint papers, fugi waters, red bulls, candy, crosswords.. &amp; He loved it
Can I cry now or later?  http://t.co/4q73tU6GEn
Alex is being so fucking cute right now. I'm melting. He keeps telling me how happy he is and how I'm the best  how did I get so lucky?!
It's the little things  http://t.co/Xb6Yfnn0d5
I need to find myself some buddha for the week 
But the next 6 days without him are gonna be so sad 
My boyfriends mom and I get along so well. Every time I'm over there she tells me how happy she is that we're together. It's so comforting
My dad just goes \"what happened to ya neck did ya fall on a cigarette ya asshole.... And I call u asshole in a loving manner\" 
@krislynhunter I'm gonna have to try that!' Hahahah thanks PRINCESS 
I hate when people call themselves \"princess\" or make their boyfriends call them that. Bitch you ain't royal, sit down peasant.
So classy, yes I know.
Trying to cover up these fucking hickeys before my dad arrives is impossible. Their legit purple and hurt to touch.
@krislynhunter ahhhh that's awesome. Isn't it nice to feel like your hair is like not dead hahaha
@krislynhunter ahhhhh those sound amazing. You have to tell me how they work!!
@krislynhunter my hair feels sooooo nice and the ends look 10x better, plus my hairs like so soft and silky with no frizz. It's bomb.
@krislynhunter it's literally just garnier fructis marvelous oil for blow drying and the sleek and shine for straightening. It's amazing 
Loving the new hair products I got for Christmas... My hair looks ten times less dead than 3 days ago.
Just got out of the shower feeling all nice and clean... Walk into the kitchen to see Emma has the garbage everywhere... COOL
While brushing my teeth I brushed too far back on my tongue and threw up in the sink. So I had to brush my teeth twice.
@King_Queenshit the struggle
Blaire always finds my moms camera, brings it to me, gets on the floor, poses and says \"cheeeeese\" 
Maybe if my mom got laid she wouldn't be so damn cranky all the time.
My dad and his girlfriend have been dating for about 15-16 years with no intention of getting married and are still so happy. I love that
@brieemuccie hahahaha wouldn't want it any other way 
2014 sucked. I plan on making 2015 my year. I'm gonna be 24, it's about time to make some moves.
Then date night with my boy since he leaves tomorrow 
My dad &amp; his girlfriend are coming to celebrate Christmas with me and blaire today  she still has presents wrapped under the tree! #spoiled
Blaire has slept till 9 or a little after the past 3 days and I couldn't of asked for a better Christmas present.
Laying next to Blaire sleeping and she's laughing away.. I wish I knew what she was dreaming about
Just ate an entire bag of Hershey kisses while laying in bed... The sad part is this is normal for me.
@krislynhunter don't let it get to you. Karma is a real bitch. At least you can rest your pretty little head down tn knowing you aint them
@krislynhunter people are pathetic and disgusting. It's so sad.
@BrittDeJesus_ 
@FemalePains: My motto for 2015: http://t.co/Shhrwjyh3f @Rachelkb1994
Wrote Alex the longest plane letter... He's gonna kill me  but he's gonna love it.
Hope you enjoy creeping my shit.
Officially too fat for my liking. It's time to switch from beer to liquor, pizza, wings and nachos to salad &amp; add a little physical activity
Bitch you ain't cute, stop acting like you run shit 
@v3ntoxo miss you too! And yes, we need to catch up!  love you beautiful

I fucking hate girls. Seriously girls are the fucking worst.

Time for this momma to relax with some bowls, a big glass of sunnyd &amp; it's always sunny on my mac 
Those moms who beg for followers but don't follow anyone back... Good job

The kmart commercial is a bunch of pregnant women dancing.... Why
Chinese for dinner.. Absolutely positively pumped
She's seriously taking the nap of the century. 3 hours and still knocked.
Blaire has been napping for the past 2.5 hours 
@krislynhunter well, if we're ugly at least we got makeup, and we get to carry bags with all our shit everywhere &amp; we get more free shit
I'm so happy I'm a girl and not a guy.
My child is almost 2 
As much as I love company when I smoke, it's so fucking relaxing doing a solo sesh 
 omg emmmmmma
When my dog farts it honestly makes my eyes water
When you have 1 bowl pack left till tomorrow, do you wake &amp; bake or save it for before bed tonight? #thestruggleisreal
Really wish my boy was here cuddled up with me and Blaire 
Really need a mini-fridge in my room.
I believe in ghosts
@ThcHunny112 
Blaire is sleeping &amp; now it's time to watch some netflix and smoke some bowls

My therapist told me a good way to work through my social anxiety is by doing something I like w no friends... So I'm alone at a bar 
A beer, a bowl &amp; a bunch of ciggs before heading into work .. Feel so much better 
When you finally get your makeup back after it being at your friends house for 2 days it seriously is like Christmas morning 
Absolutely loving the new and improved \"block\" button on here. I've already blocked like 5 people 
I feel bad for your boyfriend.
Woke up craving a BLT
Bye Felicia 
Lol I'm actually flattered everyone is so interested in my personal life but why don't you just call me up &amp; ask instead of twatching?

When blaire decides to sleep in, I wake up early AF. But those days when blaire decides to wake up at the crack of dawn, I wanna sleep in 
Craving red lobster biscuits like no other
Lighting some candles, putting on Christmas music and decorating with Blaire to try and get in the Christmas mood 
So happy my work isn't a dreadful place to go to
Working so much this week 
Lunch date with the boy before work 
The bartender at champs knows exactly what I want when I walk in &amp; how long I've been waiting for it  #madelf #cantresist

I hate girls that are like wanna do s4s I only have 50k followers!
Love how the mom that use to bash me on here now does meth, looks disgusting &amp; doesn't have her child now what were you saying 'bout me?

I can't tell if Blaire is going through her \"almost terrible twos\" or if she is going to grow up and be just like me 
Just posted a photo http://t.co/Ieopqci29X
Blaire has one of the worst attitudes 

I should really do my nails before Thursday.
Blaire has been acting up so bad lately.. I'm seriously wondering where I got all this patience from.
Alex seriously saves me from my breakdowns every single time. If it weren't for him and blaire I would go crazy.
My mom makes me wanna kill myself... This can't be normal 
My dreams have been beyond fucked up lately.
Laying here watching my babygirl sleep and I just don't know how I got so blessed.
Talk about munchies.. Yes, that's apple pie in the middle  http://t.co/aPOp12cRoO
Can't wait for date-day with Alex on Thursday 
Blaire is honestly too smart with this kindle
Me and Alex wrestled on his dads kitchen floor the other night &amp; my body is literally bruised, from head to toe
He's just too cute  \n#mine #mcm http://t.co/YFwwCuPceJ
 http://t.co/06Vc4aC6Xi

@Missliteeyes 
Made close to $400 in tips yesterday. Not too shabbbby
Blaire and I just took a 4 hour nap together 
One of my tables just left without paying an $80 check.... But left me a $20?
Over 600 reservations today 
I need to move to Colorado
Argued with her for about 15 minutes to put gloves on and as you can see, she won... BUT it only took http://t.co/WiRcVhxeau
fries before guys
At least I work somewhere that's gonna be overflowing with food &amp; I'll have my work family 
At least I work somewhere that's gonna be overflowing with food &amp; I'll have my work family 
Just found out my aunts having thanksgiving dinner at 12 which means I'll miss another holiday meal thanks to work.
@Missliteeyes I know!! I melt 
Blaire always gives Emma about 5 hugs and kisses before we go out anywhere #bestfriends #mygirls http://t.co/eDYHlD6gYF
You're on tinder but put your boyfriend as your \"mcm\"....
I think the hardest person to love is yourself http://t.co/R4A4QJx8qO
Seriously can't believe you fucking stalk me on here....
Winning http://t.co/mKgbxODtY5
Closet full of clothes and I still have nothing to fucking wear
White grape juice is the shit
Or at least Blaire does... Every time I take a video of her she loves to watch it over and over again
I feel like kids will have more vivid memories of their toddler years than we did b/c they watch videos of themselves on our phones a lot..
@BrittDeJesus_ omg! That's like my almost 2 year old - she already knows how to work my kindle!
@soulfulvixson agreed!
@soulfulvixson I MISS YOU!
I can wear my hello kitty slippers, guitar hero pajama pants, pink carhartt and smoke a bogie in peace... And not embarrass myself 
Sometimes I hate where I live but it's so nice with like no neighbors and all woods... It's peaceful.
 http://t.co/nKceUBYqDv
My anxiety attacks have been so bad recently. Literally my legs go numb &amp; I throw up constantly.
Everyday, Blaire takes her toothbrush and brushes all her stuffed animals teeth. It's too cute 
@justmejudesss miss and love you beautiful!
14 degrees today, 51 tomorrow.
What the hell is wrong with girls these days
Blaire didn't touch her earrings the whole first year, now she won't stop taking them out &amp; I'm pretty sure they closed up 
Blaire sleeping next to me has got to be the best feeling ever. She's just so cuddly. I'm beyond lucky.
Alex asked me what my favorite color roses are.. I told him black. His response was, \"oh of course, so they match your fucking heart\" 
Story time with the babe. She picks out the same 4 stories every single night 
Sometimes you gotta zig while everyone else is zagging  http://t.co/tvdmSqopZ6
Straight up now tell me do you really wanna love me forever or is it just a hit and run

\"Pick somewhere you wanna go eat keep me in mind\" \n\"Well obviously I'm not gonna bring you to a titty bar..\n\nThey don't serve food there\"\n
It's all about the he said she said bulllshit
My daughter dips her cheese in ranch and ketchup.... Yup.
Since Blaire insists on drawing on the tv, walls and our kindle, I think Santa is gonna be brining her an easel for Christmas
Blaire is a psycho just like me. The girl has no fear and a pain tolerance higher than half the dudes I know.

Honestly what the fuck would I of been doing in bed for the past 2 hours if I didn't have a phone? \n\nOh right, probably sleeping 
Sad to say but the things I would do for a crunch wrap supreme right now are disgusting.
Tailgating with my work family tomorrow starting at 9am. This should be interesting.
If I don't go to bed with blaire when I put her down, then it takes me forever to get to sleep.
@haleyandaddison  coming!
@haleyandaddison are you me?!
If YOU'RE gonna insult someone, please  spell shit right. YOU'RE embarrassing.

Blaire is out shopping for the day with grandma and it's 65 degrees out. Sounds like a perfect opportunity to day-drink with the boy 
Before I start to blow dry my hair I whip my head around in like 20 circles... It like pre-dries my hair.
I use visine even when I don't just smoke... It just makes me eyes this really nice white 
@haleyandaddison thank you! I sit on the ledge next to it and my feet just chill in the sink. Lmao
Does anyone else practically sit in the sink when doing their makeup? I like to be super close to the mirror...
Okay, I'm done. Everyone can carry on with their lives now.
I was not a good student but some of you make me look smart AF.
Can you please date for like a month AT LEAST before getting a house together. Y'all stupid AF.
Every mom, all around the world should stop whatever their doing at this exact second, and just take a nap. Let's just do it.
Blaire is throwing the biggest fit because I won't let her wear her chucks.... She's a size 6, their a 4. Do you see the struggle?
Don't mind the mess or my pjs but I check my stomach fat everyday &amp; look who started copying me... http://t.co/UV87La6Y0R
Sometimes when Blaire whines for no reason I cover my ears and say \"Blaire, this is so unnecessary\"
@mommyandhadley omg jordan..... Never again please 
It's funny how so many people who think they know me, know nothing at all. And I bet if they did, they wouldn't blame me for being so cold.
Girls apparently always have a problem with losing bobbipins. See, I never lose mine... Their all just bent from using them for my bowl.

Bipolar bitch right hereeeeeee
It amazes me how angry I can get in two seconds, over nothing.
I really enjoy a lot of my \"mom friends\" on both sites, don't get me wrong... But chilllll with this shit - idgaf about your confessions.
Like, what?
I can't imagine being like \"oh, sorry I can't go on a date Mondays past 9 cause I have to post confessions for other girls\".................
Some of you moms need a life. Instagram and twitter shouldn't be as important as you make it out to be. You ladies need more hobbies.
@xoxo_bekah at least you have an excuse! And yours isn't fat. Plus, it looks good! Lol

The time has come.. Blaire &amp; I are officially looking for a new place to live. 
Blaires new room in a few weeks  http://t.co/ZLP8DFMeOZ
She's a wild one, with an angels face  http://t.co/Ab68mGy2An
It's wayyyy too cold out
The babe is down for a nap &amp; now it's time to smoke a bowl and do some laundry 
@xoxo_bekah Getttt it girlllll
 http://t.co/82snxllOJR
Do I look like a hunter? http://t.co/jGjysdBDRI
So tonight for the party, blaire is little red riding hood, my grandmas the grandma, my moms the wolf &amp; I'm the hunter 
I wonder how many people get butthurt looking at tweets everyday 
Working a \"magic\" tournament today 
Literally brick outside
Blaire was really the cutest little red riding hood I've ever seen http://t.co/2IEG3WJJmf
How do people give my daughter Cheetos in her candy bag and expect me not to eat those...
It takes someone very brave to take care of and sleep next to a bitch with strep  http://t.co/MUvxMiRm7j
It takes someone really brave to sleep next to a bitch with strep... #browniepoints #thebest http://t.co/GWD6uyoD9S
So beers, personal joints &amp; the nightmare before Christmas 
Alex came home with two 6 packs and an eighth  my mannnnnn
Homeostasis probs
All within the last hour
I've gone from sweatshirt &amp; yogas to tank top &amp; yogas to long sleeve &amp; yogas to shirtsleeves and yogas to shorts and short sleeves..
@PostGradStoners 
I'm either sweating or freezing
Seriously thinking about asking Alex to pick me up a Gatorade on the way home so I can add some vodka to it - I'm sure that'd numb my throat
In and out of sleep alllll day. I can't eat anything.. Except bags on bags of halls (which do jack shit by the way)
A little green is a different story...
My throat hurts so bad that I've had zero desire to smoke a cig today... Maybe this is a way to quit!
Alex has work till 10 &amp; I'm currently cuddled up in his bed about to take a nice 6 hour nap w/ no interruptions or little fingers up my nose
 http://t.co/P2O6JtOIsS
Can somebody pleassssee help me - I'm currently miserable AF. Anybody know anything to help (besides my medication)
Lmao the shit my friends send me  http://t.co/m7LzrCHq0m
@DaStayHomeMomma thanks mama
@kelsey_bahner thank you baby!' Miss you!
So my doctor didn't even do a test, she looked back at and said \"yep, that's strep alright\" 
All I wanna do is curl up in Alex's bed and sleep all day long..
Omg my throats so bad 
Alex always hates me in the morning, I'm always poking him and climbing all over him  the kid doesn't wake up till 1... It's 6:15
My glands are so swollen that my neck looks fat. I literally feel like garbageeee
We are not the same, I am a martian
Working an event &amp; the governors wife is here... Her bodyguards are fiiiiiiiiiine 
#fuckyou
My hands won't stop shakkkkkking
I hate when the old creepy golfers try &amp; make moves.. Like bitch just tip me
Hop your pretty ass up in this fuckin' car
So we do it how we do it
With all the hotdogs and beer I consume at work I should be a whale.
I love how people think it's insulting to call me a bitch 
IDONTGIVEAFUCK
Me and my mom fight every single day. It's probably the unhealthiest relationship.
My moms driving is 1 thing that triggers my anxiety. I don't blame myself for smoking 5 bogies when I get out of the car.
Good morning twatchers  enjoy a fun filled day of stalking!
Being too insecure is a turn off.. #rememberthat
Can't. Stop. Coughing.

Is this real life  my gaaaaawd
Lol what the fucking fuck
My daughters favorite song is snapbacks and tattoos 
Got a job I enjoy with people I love, got an internship w a great hospital next week, graduated school, got a healthy kid &amp; a great guy. So

I'm wearing a shirt that was actually a shirt when I was pregnant and it's now a dress. So I'm wearing a dress. Oh well

\"You left your cheetah socks here... But don't take them, cause every time I see them they remind me of you\"  crazy &amp; weird but im melting
My boy took me &amp; blaire to dinner tonight &amp; read to her while I ate. 
 http://t.co/zDY4mlfLO6
Haven't had a bogie all day and I feel like I'm dying.
Always have a case on my phone.. Go out one night without it on &amp; I now have about 15 scratches, 8 indents &amp; about 4 chunks missing.
Carried around a crown royal bag last night as my pocketbook. It actually worked quite well
Fuck it's 3:30 and I'm so hungover already
Should I go to the psu tailgate after work or should I not .... hmmmm hard decision.
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Idgaffffffff
Wakey wakey beer and bakeyyyy
It's kinda like.. Since I sell beer, I should probably sample it a few times so I can explain how good it is.. Right?
9am drinking shocktop out of a coffee cup at work... classy.
Had to take a picture before leaving for work this morning.. My two babies shleeeeepin  http://t.co/tKp58iuyNN
I don't know who snores louder.. My dog or my daughter.
But seriously they make these gloves to hard to text in 
Like a little possessed child haha she always does this glare and it's like her head down but eyes staring up &amp; it's scary... It just is 
My monitor screen turns off to save battery &amp; I'm not gonna lie I get scared thinking about turning it on &amp; blaire standing in front of it 
@AlyssaHelm they hate you too Eliza  
I am sittin' on the clouds, I got smoke coming from my seat. I can play basketball with the moon, I got the whole world at my feet.
My mom got me these cute gloves from Alaska &amp; my hands have ever been warmer.
And then she sleeps till 8am..
People would always tell me about sleep schedules and blah blah blah. I never did that shit &amp; look how well she turned out.
Blaire is so good. You can just lay her in her crib around 12 &amp; 8:30 and she just passes out. No standing up, no fussing, nothing 
lol fuck you
Brownies with frosting &gt;&gt;&gt;
What's better than cuddles &amp; the little mermaid with my mini?#perfect   http://t.co/OpsDz2dijq
There's actually a lot of things I really don't give a fuck about
Sometimes I wish I ate really healthy... But when it comes down to it, I really don't give a fuck.
My eating habits are disgusting
How do you wake up someone at 6:15am when they look so cute and comfy  http://t.co/EQgFl7nAkf
Positive note for the day: found my ID in Alex's bed 4 days later. BAM.
@brieebalchy agreed, I keep forgetting we're not actually that far from each other. Let's plan something PLEASE
Marking his territory like a damn dog
@brieebalchy &amp; I would be such good friends if we lived closer. I'm packing up our shit and were moving closer to you. The end.
Budlight pounders at 2pm? Hey, moms can drink too!
@alyssdanielle and ever 
I'm such an asshole driver.. But a good one indeed.
Working a function this morning and their from ESPN 
Blaire was not happy when I had to wake her at 6:15. Check out her sleeping pose http://t.co/pMtJyIGeSw
Fuck it, I'm making pizza

I just love food so much
Do I actually attempt sleep or do I get up and make Ellios pizza.... The struggle is real
Twitter, Facebook &amp; Instagram really aren't that interesting yet I'm still awake creepin on all of them.
So funny how 64 motherfuckers watch my snap story but 2 of them actually snap me. 
People smoke e-ciggs to help try &amp; quit. I smoke e-ciggs so I don't have to leave my bed at night 
But knowing I have to get up in just 6 short hours for work is the worst.
Curling up in bed is actually the best feeling.
I either love you or I fucking hate you. There's no in between. Choose wisely.

@PCTKeepItClassy lmao fuck that. I couldn't care less about that shit.
@PCTKeepItClassy exactly. &amp; the fact that he actually has a good personality too just makes it that much better.
@PCTKeepItClassy I sure know how to pick em
@PCTKeepItClassy actually, that was brought out on our first date.
Well, the first 5 minutes outside and Blaire slips in dog shit. Sick
The boy took me to dinner last night, then had beers, blunts, eastbound &amp; down and cuddles waiting for me at home. You can be jealous now
Pizza for breakfast again? I think yes.

Really not looking forward to my phlebotomy midterm tonight 
I worked a 17 hour day Saturday. #newrecord
The things I would do for a triple cheeseburger right now are disgusting
6 hours into work &amp; I still smell like vomit. Only 9 hours to go!

So excited  http://t.co/hHMtSC1fes
Everytime I'm playing with my web ring &amp; it makes a certain noise I can't help but think of @alyssdanielle &amp; how much she hated it  luh you
And this headache can go away now..
I feel so alone
Blaire has this new obsession with taking her diaper off  .. why!
Messy mom bun  http://t.co/BbUJuVAKjp
Sounds awesome

The medication I'm being put on is suppose to be very effective but if you miss a day it feels like you're withdrawing from heroin
My obsession for Cheetos started when I was pregnant.. &amp; now I know why. #cheesehead http://t.co/fOY1ihNdgl

I was raped in 2011 by a Hispanic dwarf &amp; he was charged 'not guilty' yesterday. This world is so fucked up. http://t.co/EBBnVS0GQT
@kelsey_bahner tell me about it.. 
@kelsey_bahner thank you love  I appreciate it 
@kelsey_bahner last years trial it was a hung jury, 11 people said guilty &amp; 1 said not-guilty. It got violent bet the jury &amp; was cut short.
@kelsey_bahner yea, I never bring it up but I was roofied/raped back in 2011 by a townie Hispanic midget in Williamsport when I went to pct
Day 1 of my rape re-trial. Hopefully the last time I will have to be re-living this.
Cheddar Jalapeo Cheetos 
@PCTKeepItClassy cause I saw someone's tweet about how everyone has this secret bond... But no. It's not like that at all.
You think that's sad or heartless? Nope! It's called drama-free and don't have to share 
I sometimes even forget I didn't make blaire by myself..
Thanks for Blaire but i never loved you &amp; I never will.. Ya piece of shit  He never comes up in conversation and he never crosses my mind.
I honestly believe I'm the only person in the world who doesn't have that \"unspoken bond/love crap\" with their baby daddy.
Blaire is literally ALL me. Even down to her big toe. It's like God knew I didn't wanna see her dad ever again 
First day off in forever, time to enjoy the fair with my mini

@Way2Irrational lmao oh  well I disagree! Age is just a number! &amp; you know me, I do what I want! Lol in this case, I guess who I want lmao
@Way2Irrational lmaoooo I can't even figure out how to do this 
@adeleon92 ahhhhh! It's crazy! Time really does fly now!
Blaire is 2 in less than 5 months. Are you shitting me?!
If you're lonely, it'll radiate off you &amp; look like desperation. So, be careful.
Overthinking and overanalyzing get you NOWHERE. I promise you, you WILL ruin something over NOTHING.

I'm horrible at painting my nails.
Can't find any of my nailpolish which is scary considering have 100+ so I had to use this purple I found in my moms room. Purple is not me.
A huge hummingbird came to the porch &amp; I said, \"oh my god\"... 5 seconds later, blaire, who's playing quietly goes, \"oh my god\" and laughs
I think my hair would look good in a sockbun but I don't even know how to curl my hair with a curling iron never mind roll it in a sock.
I really should start doing my nails more often. Their chipped 90% of the time. And by chipped I mean theirs more nail showing than polish.
I decided to put animal crackers in my pocket after smoking a face blunt last night &amp; I woke up to Blaire finding them in bed &amp; eating them
I really need to stop eating like a 40-year-old obese man

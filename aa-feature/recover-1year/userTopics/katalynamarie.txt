How am I just now seeing this @SenSanders hot line bling music video  dying
But I can't even schedule that in for weeks because my life is crazy 
All I want in life is a massage
The world sickens me
Let's see if I make it to tattoos today
My heart is so happy
Guess whose going back to New York in 2 weeks 
@missalyssa427 I can't wait!!!
Spent the day planning Friendsgiving, dads birthday, the holiday party and charity events for the year.
I hate all holidays aside from my birthday &amp; Friendsgiving
It's my 2nd day off, debating if I should go live life or spend another 24 hours watching Netflix...
#ThugLife
It's 7PM .... Maybe I should get out of bed
Why do today what can be put off until tomorrow
How to get away with murder is the shit
I put my dog outside for 5 mins &amp; he comes back in like he hasn't seen me for a thousand years #calmdownhomie
My disappointment every time I don't wake up in some magical place 
I've seen so many shooting stars these last few months 
My mind is all over the place
Money can't buy happiness but it's more comfortable to cry in a Mercedes than on a bicycle
When you get in the car in the morning &amp; the trap is playing at full volume #okyesimawake
You know you gotta stop &amp; get down every time you hear that \"shorty get down, good lord.\"
Donivon &amp; I are pretty much the worst cooks on planet earth 
If I call you and you don't answer, please don't text me \"what's up\" I will probably ignore you for atleast a year 
I hate this singing version of hot line bling. Ew
All the shade
I seriously can't with how dumb people are
Haven't slept in about 4 days. Tomorrow means a week of detox
Went to lunch with a psychic ... Got her wasted.. You don't even wanna know what's happening now

I'm young &amp; I love to be young. I'm free &amp; I love to be free.
Debating driving to the beach rn, just to sit on the shore
I got some damn bad intentions, I got some secrets I forgot to mention. Haven't learned my lesson....
It takes me more time to decide what I want to listen to than it does to actually drive home 
I should be sleeping but vampire diaries
@Amanda_Roseeee I  YOU

Blessed for the things I don't have &amp; blessed for the things I do have.
Life is good. Blessings on blessings.
Today I've successfully managed to watch the nightmare before Christmas, hocus pocus &amp; halloweentown. If that's not productive idk what is.
Why doesn't flame broiler deliver?
It's such a great feeling to realize you're completely entitled to what you're feeling, no matter what that looks like to anybody else.
You're a basic bitch if you wear ugg boots and shorts
Public announcement: pumpkin spice leinenkugel is the shit #basic
\"I look like a jack o latern\" #famouslastwords
Girls with EDM in their bio have definitely been fingered in a porta potty at a festival by some guy in a neon tank top.

When you've been in bed sense 8pm and STILL can't fall asleep &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; #insomnia
Also, I have no voice...completely gone. 
I miss bae 
Girls don't want pizza. They want free alcohol
Can it please be tomorrow already?! 
No matter what I accomplish in this life nothing will ever mean more than being a friend to someone who needs it.
Today's snap chats have me dying 
Leave me in my bed all day
Early mornings and soft rain

I have such a good feeling about the rest of this year
Football is the only sport I thoroughly enjoy watching on TV
The monsters in my head are scared of love
Looked in the sky and saw the craziest thing 
Lol @ the fact that I live in a world where Kanye West, Deez Nuts &amp; Donald Trump are my options for president 
All the feels.
Trust your heart if the seas catch fire
My birthday is my favorite holiday

Try everything in your 20's, do every job, follow every passion. Choose at 30 &amp; dedicate 10 hard years to it. Retire at 40. #kittyadvice
Who made my Twitter albino?
Something that I love in the store, I hate 5 mins after I take it home. And that's kinda the way I feel towards men.
All that I know, is that beautiful things never last...that's why fireflies flash.
Can I RT this 5 million times over?  https://t.co/YbI0q3eGZ5

Charity beer pong tournament tomorrow at @ Franklins Cove
There's never a right time to say goodbye -
My roommate just left to Manhattan! So jealous 
Not all cops are bad. it's just my personal opinion &amp; fear.
Depressed that I live in a world were I'm terrified of police..the people who are supposed to protect us.
The meteors are soooo incredible
Going out to the lake to watch the meteor shower

Well I guess since I leave tomorrow I should pack now
@Amanda_Roseeee you're the cutest plate of wings I've ever had
I seriously can't even explain how excited I am to see my family tomorrow!!!!!
I let my tape rock until my tape pop
You call me up again just to break me like a promise, so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I will give and give until I have nothing left to give and then I will give some more
I am seriously tired...not in like a I need sleep way but in a I'm just over the bullshit way
@nyssss this is adorable
This is seriously one of the hugest growing periods in my life
Some guy just ran in front of me to open the door for me  &amp; he wasn't even going to the same place #hellochivalry
Good afternoon people. Let's change some lives today 
I know that God is working in my life right now in the craziest way &amp; even though it makes no sense I'm just glad to be apart of it
@legalizemallory all the time
If you've never been inspired before...choose now.
Get out...go love somebody
Affecting someone in a positive way...changing somebody's outlook on life..generating hope in a lost generation.
Sitting down preaching about doing good work for people &amp; changing lives. And I promise you, that's what life is about.
@legalizemallory  I love you, endlessly. Sweetest of dreams.
Xx @nyssss

@breannahanki  miss you angel. You can call/text me whenever you need anything
@Amanda_Roseeee it's okay girl. I miss you too
I want to plan another event to raise $ and awareness for modern day slavery. This is not another charitable cause. It's an emergency.
I love hard and then not at all.
@nyssss ok bb I'll get up and ready
@nyssss what time are you off? I'll come in for lunch probably
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin and fuck with the stars. You man the island, cocaine and elegant cars.
Baby girl, turn me on with your electric feel.
I have zero interest in getting out of bed
In bed with my doggies... 
@lopaigee_ happy birthday beautiful! I hope you have a day as fabulous as you! Love &amp; miss you lots!

Never doubt in darkness what God has show you in the light.
It's been an emotional &amp; crazy year so far but I'm just forever thankful for the lessons I've been able to learn.
Day 1 of sobriety
I'm such a hot mess right now
@Amanda_Roseeee well telepathically I was telling you!

Good morning kitties 
We both know it's just a matter of time before our hearts start racing down that county line
What about now? How about tonight? Baby, for once let's don't think twice. Let's take that spin that never ends.
And those small moments &amp; triumphs end up being what gives your life meaning. Promise!
Sometimes, if you love people long enough &amp; hard enough &amp; without conditions...they become a reflection of that love.
@JillianLueras true!!!! Who are we kidding ?! Blair &amp; Serena forever (yes we're in the 9th grade)

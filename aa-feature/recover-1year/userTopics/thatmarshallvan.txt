@McDonalds I've noticed some Toronto locations have different pricing than other Toronto locations. What's up with that?
@GOtransit you know what would be awesome? Power points in the buses :)
105N #ttc bus was early so now I get to wait 35 minutes for the next one. At least it's not -20.. #fuckaschedule
I love how glitchy my #instagram is. I'd much rather see blank grey spaces than pictures. Maybe because I'm not on ios7? @instagram
@YRTViva You're still using paper monthly passes? What is this, 1995?
I'd be in Guelph now instead of brampton if @GOtransit wasn't trying to 'get me home faster' Thanks guys!
@GOtransit removes an early bus and replaces it with a later train with transfers and that's supposed to be quicker? http://t.co/5TumAe1zTL
If the @YRTViva runs late, @TTChelps runs early, or vice versa with 10 minute allowances, why even bother making schedules?
@YRTViva maybe you should put more buses in service to make up for this instead of the 10 not in service buses that I see every 5 minutes
@YRTViva I'm late for work for the 3rd time this week because the 77 was 10 minutes late again @theYRTsucks
I just started using the #ttc again and now I'm going to be late for the second day in a row. Late buses yay!
I'm going to have nightmares after watching this http://t.co/g3TTbdAVHa
I'm jealous of @joelmchale 's hair
Today I reached 11 months of #sobriety without a sponsor and attending occasional meetings
Who knew #wutang would pull some diva shit? #toronto
Gotta love those days when the #ttc is so late that you could've walked to your destination in the time you spent waiting

I give thanks to my constant misfortunes #fml
@YRP We called that number and no one would assist us, they only allowed us to leave a MSG.
@YRP can you please ensure that he gets hold of us? Thanks
@YRP He told us he would be on duty for the next two days. I need the case info to proceed with insurance claim. Incident 13-279329
@YRP can you please get constable 2153 to return my emails/calls regarding the accident my mum was in Thursday night? Thanks! :)
Joel McHale is a bad actor but Alison Brie's cleavage is awesome so I still watch #community with joy

@downtowndjb It's probably the promotor using the better known name to draw a bigger crowd
@muffymace Should've recorded time, route number, vehicle number, driver description and reported it to @ttchelps
@downtowndjb I wonder what dj will be showing up that still uses the name even though they haven't released a tune in over 5 years..
@downtowndjb what type of music?
@KREAYSHAWN Jealous!
Walking dead walking dead walking dead walking dead walking dead walking dead walking dead #walkingdead #amc walking dead walking dead #yay

Andy poolhall @downtowndjb: @thatmarshallvan lol where are you?
@downtowndjb @djlovehz The problem with most trap djs is that they think there are only 10 trap tunes..
Bro, get your crutch off the dancefloor
@downtowndjb I guess you could say trap is like electro hip hop
Mid electro set trap? Sounds amazing! Electro trap!! @downtowndjb: Sooo.. Every dj plays trap now, huh?
This Swedish House Mafia tune makes me want to break shit. Don't you worry child.. Why don't you fuck off?

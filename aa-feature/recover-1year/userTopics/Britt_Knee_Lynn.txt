Sometimes you just gotta put people in their place.. And if they leave after that, they ain't meant for you.
But I've also realized, if I can't tell you how I feel &amp; you don't fix the problem and you just end up leaving me... You wasn't for me
I don't want it too happen again..
As I was talking to Tiffany, I've come to realization that I don't speak up about things because of fear of being left.. It's happened once
I need to stop being in such fear that people who mean so much too me are always going too leave me..

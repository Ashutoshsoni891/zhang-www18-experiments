This makes me more happy than I have ever been  https://t.co/94ii1LRoHg
When you're in town for the night but don't get to see your mom 
@MollyTruj I love you 
I got 10 hours of sleep last night, took a 7 hour nap today, and I'm going to bed rn. Too sick to function 
Sometimes it's hard to understand that not everything is meant to be understood..
@_jessicakanney jk I ate a donut then went to the gym instead. I'm fine
Seriously driving myself to the emergency room because my throat is swollen and I can't breathe and nobody seems to care
i miss u
@Double_D_14 I've probably said those exact words to you 
@MollyTruj but I'm in Lynchburg and you not.
yup. sitting alone in my room on Saturday nights is my fave thing to do.
Happy Birthday @Conrad_LOE  I love you and miss you so much! Have a good one
@MollyTruj hey. feels like i haven't seen ya since July or something.
@Double_D_14 I would love to be your second wheel every second of every day
Actually hate being third wheel with Kase
@Q_uhh1 I motivated you didn't I.
@Double_D_14 hell yes. Can't wait to be gone with you next weekend 
@Double_D_14 way too accurate. But I'm not ashamed 
This is so me.  https://t.co/dZDb0zEpe2
it's just I am in school to be a crisis counselor, but can't even hold my tears back watching the titanic..
everyone is fighting a battle you might know nothing about. be kind. always.
And when you get it all just remember one thing, remember one thing, one man can change the world
She is my backbone http://t.co/0kM95059uh
Kahla and Allen give me life 
Wanna drive home so bad just so my mom can hold me 
Literally heartbroken. I don't ever want to feel this way again.
It's a yoga pants, t-shirt, hair up kinda day. And that's rare for me. TGIF.
Wish I was on the rivah right now @Kmawyer12 thanks for being so great  http://t.co/u61jDIB7ds

Hate not being at Treav's games 
So hooked on Dylan Scott 
Never will I ever go to sleep without telling Treav how thankful I am for him and how much I love him. You just never know.
@elisescheeren I'm all brown again
Bye bye blonde hair 
Closure is so important to me
When you left I lost a part of me
I get to see my best friends today
Pinnacle whipped and orange soda
@MollyTruj if only I had me some of you on the side 
Nothing a little pineapple rum can't fix, am I right??
I hate that a class that has absolutely nothing to do with my major brings down my gpa.
Trying to go to sleep upset is the worst.
when in doubt, shop it out
I haven't been in this bad of a mood, ever.
@kclynn05 boneless teriyaki
If @kclynn05 really loved me she would go get me some wings 
Fuck you Fetty. Minus one fan for you, bitch. BYE.

@MollyTruj it was awkward wasn't it
@MollyTruj you're welcome, Molly
tried too hard to be a UNC fan this weekend. Couldn't do it.
It feels like fall and I am like the only one that hates it. Summer don't go 
When your family has a group chat but forgets to put you in it 
Thanks for helping me do life, Mom @ UNC https://t.co/k1IeRwn2MW

When you gotta meet up with a tinder match to get alch #4moremonths #21
@Double_D_14 I just need him.
Every single day I'm more amazed in how blessed I am to have Treavor. It's unbelievable
It's the fourth day of classes and I already slept through one 
I just don't know if I can do this all year.
I repeat: Fetty Wap is coming to Lynchburg.
you know it's a good fucking day when you run into @AliciaEng on the elevator and she informs you that FETTY WAP is coming to Lynchbug 
the good ones go if you wait too long
It's crazy how much things/people have changed in my life in the past month, good and bad.
@nikkidolin so glad I've gotten to know you guys! Come visit me any time 
Actually very high key in love with @Double_D_14 I don't wanna leave you
Determined to make today a good last day of summer.
I will pay someone good money to come replace my headlights. Anyone?
Josh leaves me today...I hate this day more and more every year 
I think it's finally time to let go..

Luckiest girl in the world, hands down.
I actually hurt more when something happens to someone close to me compared to when something happens to me.
My mother just called me to inform me of how sweet and handsome @T_Maine32 is 
Oh my goodness I hate this feeling so much..
I really don't even know how to sleep past 8
I guess time shows you who really cares..
@jcrist19 retweet

I've been waiting for Kahla in her driveway for 15 minutes, she's not even here
can't decide if I'm mad or glad that I have to stay home alone this weekend to work.
It's so important to know when to let go
Kahla always makes sure I'm home in my own bed she is a blessing
If Josh gets this raptor I'm lowkey gonna be hella jealous.
Love/hate wearing my glasses
Never will I ever in my life be a morning person
so damn attractive
I don't do feelings anymore
@T_Maine32 BYEE
I just wanna be in my bed
Slightly obsessed with Kahla 
finally falling asleep with a smile on my face

Accidentally fell in love with Bangerz all over again and can't get it off repeat 
Whenever I drink alone I get too into my feels.

Today was one of my favorite adventures https://t.co/DAAoFt972g
3:30 needs to come faster! It's too hard to see the sun shining and be stuck in Target
Be with someone that knows what they have when they have you.
Hanging out at Molly's house, without Molly, is probably the most depressing thing I've ever had to do.
Puppies and converses  https://t.co/RnmrTNbm35
@loggg_01  can't handle me. I'll be there tomorrow 7am sharpp
I need a back rub 
Proof that Molly trusts me: she just gave me the key to her house to stay there for the weekend and take care of her puppy all by myself.
Happy Birthday @loggg_01  hope you've had a good one!
Only the ones who truly care about you can hear you when you're quiet..

Goodnight
@IAmMollaaay hey what's up hello
nobody ever wants to hang out with me
if work would let me work every single day, I would. Cause I can't stand being home alone with nothing to do.
my favorite girls http://t.co/N9xqG0OLFa

I'd rather sit in bed and drink an entire bottle of wine by myself than have a social life.

@AliciaEng happy birthday pretty girl! Live it up
I'm so over working at Target.
Just walked in my room and balled my eyes out because today was that kinda day 
My back hurts so bad I would pay someone one million dollars to rub it
I just want to feel that I'm important to someone.
Being at work knowing I won't see @Conrad_LOE while I'm here sucks 
so much to say
Should I treat myself to Birkenstocks or Jack Rogers?! I can't decide.
someone please come over and just hold me
Lake day 
Thanks for always being in my space guys. And thanks becs for grabbin my boobs with confidence. https://t.co/5tZRByMzZM

can't stress enough how lucky I am to go to school so close to SML. Talk about a stress reliever 
when you're so confused that you just don't know how you feel anymore
it's crazy how a hug or cuddles can instantly change my mood. Like the feeling of being held is so satisfying.
never care too much about anyone that lets you go to bed upset
nobody said it was easy.
Today was the last day of classes, I took a bomb ass nap, and it's warm out  so I took a selfie http://t.co/voTEjzyV0q
Lack of consistency brings on lack of interest
stressed would be the biggest understatement
I want you to know that it's our time, you and me bleed the same light.

@tha_0ww I can't wait to see how beautiful Ava is congratulations!!!
@eric_r_fletcher how thoughtful in desperate need of quality time with King Thomas soon?!?
I've never craved to be hugged so bad. Someone just hug me.
I know for a fact I would sleep ten times better every night if I had someone to cuddle up with.
I'm burnt and it hurts and I love it
today was the perfect reminder that I'm way too blessed to be stressed #SMLlife @ Smith Mountain Lake https://t.co/9Td6wOcPW0

Happy Birthday to one of my favorites @Spangler18 enjoy your day! Love and miss ya bunches
Not even tired
I'll be the first to admit I'm in total bitch mode tonight

Today, April 1st, the day all gullible people DESPISE 
Missing my twin brother something extra today @KingKanney

I don't know what I want. Ever.

@elisescheeren hahaha for the better of course
For those of you that know I am FAR from a morning person, I just scheduled all my classes to be done by 10am next semester 
grumpy. just grumpy.
Lol I hate when I creep and see something and it just puts me in a bad mood.... 
Wow what a turn off....
Have you ever even lived if you haven't had an ocean water from sonic??

Has anyone else ever heard of Jell-O shot orange slices?!?
Need someone as spontaneous as I am in my life ASAP
realizing who my real friends are one day at a time..
Bored and far from tired.
I never have anyone to talk to late at night

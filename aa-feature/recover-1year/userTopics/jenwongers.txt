I have three midterms the week after halloween fucking savages
When girls don't know how to fill in their eyebrows.. just lol. Like can I borrow your sharpie?
@xxyoshixx1234 yeah it was pretty bad haha and that sucks!
@xxyoshixx1234 it was storming today so I didn't want to walk!
Went to the pumpkin patch yesterday and my arms are sore from lifting pumpkins... I think the gym gods are  trying to tell me something.
Part of the reason why I don't like going to the library is because there's never any parking.
mood: tired and hungry
I was at work and a girl said my eyebrows were goals  #mademyday
Can't really figure you out but maybe it's best if I didn't.
@kaylininnn I want to!! Send me someee
@eliannnnad I literally flipped the fuck out when I found out 
@nicolettemae I'm honestly really sad :(
@kaylininnn at least you can go and get before they close 
SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME THE BUBBIES IN MANOA ISNT CLOSING LIKE WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
You're lying if you don't have that one person whose snapstory you click right through and don't even watch.
@kaylininnn I'll try snap him next time I see him 
Not even mad that I had to wake up at 6 this morning cuz I got to see bae 
1 girl, 3 shifts, 10 hours=death
Oh my god bae talked to me today. I'm dead.
@xxyoshixx1234 but I'm poor I can't afford any

If I had nice clothes to work out in then I'd honestly go to the gym more often but no more money so oh whale

There is such a thing as giving away too much information about your life. Keep some things to yourself and off of social media, peeps.
Tried to be studious and go to the library to do hw and study BUT IT WAS CLOSED. Ugh, never again.

#flashbackfriday https://t.co/BFTOVA6t6b
Anxiety, my old friend, i know why youre back but i cant say ive missed you.
Words are pussy shit and you can say whatever you want idgaf
Sticks and stones are the only things that can break my bones
also, ive only been through 1 pack of cigarettes in 4 days. #progress
And this is my first drinking night since saturday so im feeling pretty good about it
Drinking is my vacation from the stupid.
The amount of love i feel coursing through mt veins can only be achieved with 5 drinks. Like thats a bad thing. Everyone sucks.

When you're having the best dream ever but someone fucking texts you a pic of their halloween decorations 
Tonight i guess im human so thank you for fighting and having sex with me...
It only took me 1 1/2 episodes of Mbmbam to find an outfit for my late night date that didn't make me feel like a whale
Im COLD and I love it (but only for like another month. Then ill be bitchin again).
Nobody can see my fucking emojis! #whydoesnobodyhaveaniphone #thisisnt2005 #justhaveaniphone
And obviously being seen as a heartless bitch makes me 25% happy.
I dont mind being seen as the \"heartless bitch\". I just find it find it funny how far from the truth that is.
I agreed at the time but now it kind of irks me. I am quite literally bursting with emotion all the time. Ive just learned to quiet it
Another coworker responded \"thats just how she is. Its either bad or just mediocre. The middle ground is as happy as she gets\"
Tonight i was unemotional and slightly upset. When coworker asked me how my night went i said \"it was a night that happened in my life.\"
@eliseyloo no guarantee youll fit into all of them. But maybe olivia will. i have some size 0 shorts i will probs never fit into again lol
On a brighter note, im almost done putting my enormous amount of clothes away! And i have a bunch of things to give to @eliseyloo !
Yes, that was purposely vague. I just wanted to vent my half-buzzed 4am feels.
If i could take it back, would i be where i am today? 16 year old ashley was a fucking idiot. Yet, i still understand exactly why i did it

That phrase has come out of her mouth twice today. And im gonna ballpark it at 50 times in the past 2 months
Every. Single. Day. That it is over 80 degrees outside my grandma feels the need to tell me she is \"dripping with sweat.\"

@enochjchuang @justinbieber @Usher NO
@looksakunasing ...wat
@looksakunasing what do you mean, what do i mean?
Its obviously not a bandwagon thing at this point. And its against everything ive ever said but... Idk im feeling it lately...
...i think i kinda like justin beiber.
So much for that.
I felt better... I mean i feel tired as shit but a little better mentally. Then my bf didnt listen to me and my gma started talking...
Just two glasses left...then i have to try and sleep... Fuck http://t.co/U8ExHkwLhi
Then il most likely have an anxiety attack, drink when i get off, then start this vicious cycle over again
Fuck you anxiety and depression. Two bottles of wine is kicking your ass. Of course, until morning...
But i drink coffee now i guess so i should feel like a million bucka real soon
Not sure if hungover or still drunk...
Frosty  https://t.co/oO88evfSVj
I have 5 ice cube trays. Not enough to keep the cocktails flowing for more than 2 rounds
@Good_Diction youre not the only one according to my snapchat views
Moments before JENGA https://t.co/SVPyIdSjDU
Ugh pepsi is so inferior to the one true soda, Coca Cola.
Oh they're also all indie movies. That makes sense.
Why is Kristen Wiig in so many of my suggested movies on netflix?
\"What is it meemawh?\" \"...its Yeemick.\" Lol @TheZoneCast
@ashleyxwhoa btw @eliseyloo u know i was talking bout les mis ugh why did we do that the day after i got mugged? Lol
@eliseyloo u fkin doughnut
@eliseyloo a scorpio would say that psh
bad-assest thing while still feeling like a lady? opening your beer with your tube of mascara
Also, all these medical case ideas are from scrubs and house
Not all actors are singers
Its making my anxiety worse. Theyre so bad
Forgot i was in the middle of THE FUCKING SINGING EPISODE
Wake up with anxiety so im like lets watch greys anatomy

Dammit timehop stop showing me how cute i used to be
Youve been lead on. Yes you were wrong the whole time. Youve been lead on. Completely wrong the whole time...
I will not let the accomplishments of others make me feel bad about myself. I am doing just fine.
Walked into my work today and everyone was calling me Smashley. Got a little faded last night
Uggggg i hate being drunk awake.
This is how peety likes to travel https://t.co/wzsrPjsbf5
So i drank 3 cups of coffee to stay awake while working. I dont even like coffee. And now i cant sleep even though im exhausted. Yay...
Banana are life 
He just left to get food and asked me if i wanted anything. He looked at me like i was insane for requesting a banana and orange juice
Definitely save my tired ass in the last 2 hours we were moving. But now we're alone and nick's agitated vibe is giving me anxiety.
Half an adderal was... An idea. Good or bad? We'll find out in a few hours.
Stayed up til 6am. Woke up at noon. My veins are pumping redbull and nicotene
Spent the last hour napping. I dont know how to Saturday-night anymore.
Another reason why journalism is still in my blood. Doing things at the last minute because there are so many other things to do
Last minute is the only way to get things done
I have ANOTHER saturday off and this time I don't have a million things to do. I mean, i should be packing my house, but whatever
Eyes 
Look into my
I may not have gotten a degree or mastered an instrument, but i do know how to rock a hangover http://t.co/x5Gb5NKXlv

She keeps it Pumping straight to my Heart
Beat me out of me
@eliseyloo its okay im stuffing my face with pizza now lol
Shopping at the mall in sweatpants and frizzy hair surrounded by slutty teenagers. Feeling very body conscious
He brought me back 2 chicken sandwiches. He's learning
I hate everything
beautiful sim wedding i will never forget you
And he left to go get me the right sandwich after that because my eyes went black and a guttural cry escaped me
And i was yelling while telling him this and trying ti exit the game and i clicked exit instead of save and exit
Chicken sandwich. Just wanted a damn chicken sandwich. The dollar menu chicken sandwich. Not some spicy saucy bullshit
Srsly the amount of rage im feeling is unreal
I understand all those video game rage videos now
Im so angry right now
And nick got me the wrong thing from jack in the box because he didnt listen to me
Ive been playing the sims for 3 hours and forgot to save fuuuuuuuuuuck
Just come for one, she says... https://t.co/HPYj8OrM3U

Nevermind. I just updated my phone to get the new emojis. They changed it to frequently used. Good

How is it possible to hate myself more. I just wanna sleep!!!
I WAS ALMOST ASLEEP 5 MINUTES AGO
OMG WHY
Since when did i become in charge of all the things and have responsibilities and shit
I miss being invisible
Fuck.
Fuck i gotta be to work in 6 hours. Whatever
Its like i still kinda feel shitty (im over the bad part of my cold so not terrible) but im also very awake
Its weird being drunk and sick. Ive never done it before. New levels of alcoholism i guess.
@eliseyloo me too. Do you have a fever yet? Its awful.
@eliseyloo WAT? I havent see. You in over a month!
This is the end...
@eliseyloo i mean its true. Anyone trying to pass it off as a food is a lie. Its a drink. Thats why i need a grilled cheese too
@eliseyloo just when im sick. Maybe that why i dont like it. Negative association
I drink orange juice after i brush my teeth because i love orange juice and im not a little bitch 
Its cool. Ill just drown in my own phlegm. 
All i want is someone to make me a grilled cheese sammich, soup and oj. #askingtoomuch
Nick is NOT a good caretaker. Sicky ashley is not pleased.
Should i sleep? I dont wanna.
Almost 80% sure i used the right punctuation and i feel good about it

I think im getting sick from stress. Damn. Havent been sick in like 7 months
@Good_Diction but ima watch the emperors new groove cuz that shits good regardless
@Good_Diction usually like 8 hours a day. But this was 24 whole hours. Woke up drunk and continued to be. It was intense. In ready to sleep
Who gives a FUCK about an oxford comma
All i did was drink, sleep, eat and spill
Ugh being drunk for 24 hours is exhausting

At least i cant smell it from three blocks away like it would be at a mall
This candle i bought at bath and body works makes my house smell like an abercrombie and its kinda nice.
My landlords live above me nd they are fine ppl who never complain about us at all. But i still avoid them at all costs.
My bf is so cute gawd
Well, I went to my first AA meeting tonight...
@Good_Diction i prefer binge drinker. its not the not drinking thats a problem. its the how to stop once i get started.

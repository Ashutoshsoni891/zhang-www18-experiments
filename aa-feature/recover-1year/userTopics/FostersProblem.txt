There's a full moon tonight, watch the ER look like a zoo tonight.

@mad_d33 Bless up! https://t.co/HVYljlE7xC
I swear this is gonna be the last wave of white supremacy this country experiences after this assholes term is up, enough is enough.
Not this bullshit they have on the networks now
I wish TV sitcoms were good again. Like That 70s Show, Fresh Prince, Seinfeld, Martin, Living Single, Boy Meets World good again
I'm done bro
Strip a land of its Natives, strip them of their heritage, build a country built on the backs of slaves for free...
But this country is just one big scam, the greatest hustle ever pulled.
Home of the brave is for those that are bold enough to believe that change can and eventually will occur in a place like this...
Land of the free only applies to the ones who oppress
In regards to the rest of the world I'm not always proud to be an American
I hope everybody in Florida and in the Caribbean is safe thru Irma
Imma shoot my shot dammit, gotta let go of my old low self-esteem habits and actually give myself some points for just being me
@mad_d33 I mean, I just do other shit now since I've been back lol
Stepping up and about to see if this girl is down to like...go out on a date Friday. If not, I won't be crushed, at least I tried lol
I owe it all to this precious soul @mad_d33
Wynwood has my heart
I'm all for kickbacks and house parties, but I'm over the DMV bar/club scene after getting back from Miami. Wood Tavern shits on everything!
Flaked is such a relatable show for people in recovery.
I'm pissed off about this Looney Tune administration killing the Dream Act. Fuck the GOP and their asshat of a leader
Shield your dreams.
Protect your heart
@Glencocolaflare @LupeFiasco Have I ever told you that you're awesome and I love you?! https://t.co/9GvQ8PfJPI
We need another heat wave, I'm not ready for the hoody season yet, but bring on the pumpkin spice lattes I'm here for it!
I wanna eat this Popeyes, but I think I'll play Madden and knockout and eat that tomorrow
Ya got me smitten kitten.
Not to mention she's quite easy on the eyes too
I gave my crush her card today and I felt incredible doing it. To be attracted to someone's creativity, their style, and energy is dope
...because if it were my doing I wouldn't be here, I wasn't supposed to be here given my history of self-destruction, but I am.
Looking back at all of the friends from rehab I lost and those that have died over the years, I'm lucky to still be here
God's plan for me is to help people, whatever avenue that's through I'll figure it out. To receive is great, but I lust giving.
I remember I used to bitch about not knowing what my purpose in life was and bitching about it constantly, it's not like that anymore.
I hit three meetings today and had a blast, can't wait to see what tomorrow has in store.
Stay in the moment, but don't get caught up in the moment, continue to push forward.
I'm spiritually grounded again and I feel fantastic.
Never underappreciate the little things in life. In your eyes it's nothing, but to the next man who has not it's a luxury.
Just grateful that I can make it home safe at night
Terps won?! Oh shit! Tight! https://t.co/masUzOKNRm

@angeezyd Don't stoop to their level, save your energy for something more positive and effective.
But to not open a 16k+ seated church up to people in crisis is absolute hypocrisy
It's crazy how much power society gives people of a certain status, but all along they're greedy, selfish, and hypocritical just like us
I hope my mom is reading about how hypocritical this so-called "man of God" is sitting on his millions while a city in need is underwater...

#ThingsNotToSayToAPatient oh after a while all of the screams and beeping just become background noises, it's the smells that bother me.
#ThingsNotToSayToAPatient Oh I miss the good ole days when you could turn patients away from the ER if they didn't have insurance
#ThingsNotToSayToAPatient you work here right? I'll let everyone in the breakroom know you're here? You're here for a groin itch right?

#ThingsNotToSayToAPatient there's nothing wrong with your kid, they're just fat...
#ThingsNotToSayToAPatient you think you feel bad now, wait till you see your bill!
#ThingsNotToSayToAPatient sorry ma'am, your insurance is no longer active...sike!!!
#ThingsNotToSayToAPatient you could've saved 85% percent or more by going to CVS instead of coming to the ER for a headache.
#ThingsNotToSayToAPatientMe: Hello sir, my name is Foster, and who is this with you, your mother?PT: No, that's my wifeWife:

I wanna be a graduate and thrive doing something I truly love, not just a college dropout who was successful just having a steady job
I'm ready for the good shit in life I didn't think I deserved before.
I'm ready to start taking chances on myself again
I've been more than inspired and motivated by my friends, the city, and knowing that I can accomplish anything I set my mind to.
I'm going back to school in spring 2018! (PENDING IF THE WORLD ENDS IN NUCLEAR WARFARE)
I think I wanna give contacts a try, I love my glasses, but I'm actually starting to love and appreciate my face more without em lol

I don't have notecards or a prompt written down, I'm just going to speak from my heart and give it up to God to guide me this evening.
Everything else is secondary
But my only job in giving this lead tonight is carrying the message of hope to one who is still sick and suffering.
I want the lead to be funny yet insightful, entertaining but powerful
If anything, it's just my pride and ego talking to me, insisting that I knock it out of the park.
I'm not afraid to admit that I'm a bit nervous and anxious about leading a meeting this evening.

I don't get into commercial pizza debates with people, I just say Ledo's, and watch everybody shut the fuck up and agree with head nods.
We're all gonna die one day and I refuse to put any energy into trying to defeat the evils of the world; life's too short for that bullshit.
I just don't care anymore about human rights, equality, or any of that shit. I can only live in my world and manage my world accordingly
Police brutality, white people being blatantly racist and ignorant, ridiculous violent crimes are so normal to see on a camera the days
I'm so sick of seeing hatred and evil all day and everyday on the internet. I'm so desensitized that I just scroll past it. I don't care.
@ilaurita It's not really pain lmao. It's just an annoying, constant pinch

@Tilishaaa Oh yea, I'm just reflecting on the past, but I'm great today!
By God's grace, I'm here today to share this with y'all.
Today I choose life, everytime.
And given where I was, this time last year, is why I'm in disbelief
I have a light in my life now, I'm out of the darkness and it's only gonna get better
I only throw up when I'm sick
I was always the one who never made it home awake
I can be the designated driver for my friends now lol, imagine that.
I can finally travel!
I feel capable of doing anything I set my mind to
I can look people in their eyes when I talk
I answer my phone and check my mail without fear
I can show up for my friends and know that they love and support me on this journey called life.
I chase sunsets these days
I ate dinner and bowled at a place that I used to walk by every day on the Georgetown canal high as fuck
But today, shit is so much sweeter!
My bottom was taking 50-70 milligrams of ambien praying that I wouldn't wake up
My bottom was my grandmother finding me in the bathtub after an overdose and blood alcohol poisoning.
My bottom was not showing up for people when I originally said I would.
My bottom was feeling like me not being here was a much better alternative, that's just how sick I was.
Waking up out of blackouts at work not knowing what I had said to my coworkers and patients, or even how I had go there in the first place.
Just me and my drugs and alcohol...and I was okay with that.
And let's not even get started on relationships, I had none.
I was afraid to open my mail or answer those 1800/888 phone numbers because I knew who was calling on the other end
Money for bills I never paid
Constantly lying to friends and family about my mental state. Constantly lying to family, manipulating them into giving me money
Watching Netflix from my phone because I couldn't afford a fucking tv
Cutting my wrists in blackouts, getting used to hanging out with myself and my dark thoughts
...I felt when I was alone
I had plenty of good times in my using career, but those good times were easily outweighed by the loneliness, depression, and misery...
I finally learned how to roll up towards the end of my 8 month relapse
I even crushed a couple of ambien up in my blunts
I was often at the Cliff in Georgetown getting high right after work, then I'd wander the town, go home, and smoke more and pop pills
Just a year ago, suicide seemed like a good idea and I was a complete slave to weekends
One week from today I will acknowledge one year of sobriety, and I am in total disbelief

And my coworker made a comment to him about letting the white passengers on for free and not giving her a break...guess what he said...
Straight up Uncle Tom...its sad to see, but fuck that dude.
Then the nigga proceeds to have conversations about how Black people can do better, how he'd prefer a white woman over a Black one any day
But let a white person get on, he might as well start shucking n jiving with that "oh that's fine" "oh c'mon now, don't even worry bout it"
When Black people get on the bus, this nigga won't continue driving until the machine verifies that the patron has paid in full for a ride.
So I've met a real life Uncle Rukus, and he drives the Ride-On Bus in Silver Spring...

Rest in peace to the 12 friends I lost last year to addiction and overdoses.
I gotta thank God, the people in the rooms, and my awesome ass friends and family for supporting my on my journey to an improved me.
Came to believe in a God of my own understanding and now I have hope even in the most hopeless situations.

And they have the nerves to try and clown or prejudice us on our names...
I can only imagine what some muthafuckas named Tiddlyham Bumbershoot and Pippa Middleton are gonna name their child???
I'm gonna enjoy a bottle of water and sleep tonight because I have a long ass day ahead of me tomorrow, but luckily I'm off.
I was hungry earlier, but fuck it, that Z Burger will have to meet until tomorrow to meet my stomach lol
Night's like tonight are not my doing at all, God, my higher power, the universe did it all
I had an incredible time and I wasn't even planning on it
We danced, we joked, we left
And shockingly after all the damage they know I've done, they were happy to see me too
Then I saw her boyfriend and her friends, one of which had just graduated today with a master's in international security (whoa)
I gave her the biggest hug I could and lifted her off her feet because I was just as thrilled to see her
And while I dancing by myself, I noticed that nose and that hair and grabbed her as she lit up with joy and excitement to see me
I could've checked out the dancefloor, left and went home after my first coke and called it a night, but for some reason I stayed.
Even though she was a tad drunk when she saw me, the love was definitely still there and that made my entire weekend worthwhile.
And by out there I'm talking the drugs and alcohol
It was great given the condition of our friendship is in crisis mode and it's all because of shit I was doing when I was out there
I ran into my bestfriend and had a great time.
Tonight was one of those nights I'm glad that I didn't come straight home and trusted my gut for the first time in a long time.
Sure, the amount of energy drinks and cigarettes I smoke aren't the healthiest alternative, but at least I don't want to die anymore.
I'm noticing gradual changes in my life in a day to day basis, and I owe it all to God and my willingness to remain sober
I remember when my instincts were dangerous and reckless.

Those little drones bees was fucking shit up! Nuh uh! Not in these streets! I like fruit and all my veggies Nigga! Protect the bees nigga!!!
I'll be damned if a nigga tries to come up with some electronic drone bees to replace the ones we killed off and let doe out!
So umm...i just watched the last episode of Black Mirror and the only message I got from it was SAVE AND PROTECT THE MUTHAFUCKIN BEES NIGGA!
Yesterday I told a nigga to be safe out here after gave him directions and he said "fuck that, be dangerous!" And that's been in my head...
Life is too short forreal man. Nigga are out here dropping like flies over bullshit and pure evil.
Rest in peace Brandon Pope, can't believe that shit man
Bruh if y'all haven't watched Grace &amp; Frankie, please treat yourself! Get outside of your homophobic brain's and laugh at this shit lol
@ilaurita Lappy
I'm getting these Hirshhorn tix today dammit!!! May the force be with me !
A new week, a fresh start, another opportunity to be great and strive to be better than we were/felt last week. Make it count!
Happy Monday y'all!
Bruh I didn't even get to say "hello" before the lady said "10 piece traditional hot bbq, right?" I love Americas Best Wings yo, they know!
@LawanVanida This is so appropriately relevant lmao
Since I got sober I've been fucking up the dancefloor like... https://t.co/emuieO6fy1
Bouta go to this sober function tonight out in Falls Church and turn up with energy drimks, cigarettes and real conversatiom...and a DJ!
I just got an email from Adidas about the Yeezy boosts being on sale for 549.99, they're so fucking ugly though! Why would I ever?! Lol
...and not to mention, seen as a joke
I hope those #fyrefestival richy rich can finally understand how the people of New Orleans felt to be stranded and lied to about retreat
I can only keep what I have by giving it away
I can never forget that it was the Hope House that saved my life over the summer, so I always have to remember to give back
Had an awesome time speak at the treatment center today
But it has all been worth it.
I've been up since 4 and I gotta go to work now, God give me strength lol
Nando's never fails
I had a nitemare that I couldn't cry anymore
@LauRenxExCarter I can dig it, don't dwell on it too much though
Imma reward myself with a full day of rest on this beautiful gray and rainy day
I can't indulge in gluttony just because I'm feeling good, im not even hungry; I'm more sleepy than anything.
@LauRenxExCarter Just walk with grace and you will be just fine. What's stressing u tho?
@MetalMavenHachi
@LauRenxExCarter I'm feeling grateful and powerful this morning! How are you?!
@FreakyDtweets Oh fuck Nahh, but then again that's good for them. Business is booming lol
@FreakyDtweets The one around my way is usually pretty cool at picking up, Imma save that trip for another day though lol
@LauRenxExCarter Hi Ren!!!!!
@_JaySimms Thank u!!!
I don't do those live video things on social media because 1. I'm not popping like that 2. I don't want people in my bidness lol
You like who you like and love who you love, but if you're going after a certain type only to shame another type then your fetishizing.
I always feel POWERFUL after my meetings, great way to start and end my day. So much love, support and hope in the rooms.
@X_Haze I'm good with this path I'm on right now, I've learned my lesson
I'm definitely treating myself to some wings today!!! America's Best better pick up that line lol
My addict/alcoholic mind knows that I have one more run at relapse left, but does God have another recovery left for me? I don't wanna know
I'm still in my development phase, and I'm one hell of a person, I'll be damned if I turn back now.
I used to think that getting sober in my 20's was gonna be the end of my life, but oh boy was I wrong. I'm just getting started baby!
Nine months clean &amp; sober today!!! 3/4's on my way to a year! #onedayatatime #serenity #tothineownselfbetrue https://t.co/hZyPyOBaNO

I had a fantastic run, and I wouldn't trade those memories for anything in this world. From the Boom Boom Mansion, to Padonia Village
If we put as much energy into something positive the way we do with bullshit, we would power the universe.
Perfect sleeping weather today
I don't care if it's not the humane thing to do, my trust in society is at an all-time low
Homeless people always have some sort of out of whack anecdote to give right before I tell em no
I don't get into online debates anymore about music, Imma feel the way I feel and you're gonna feel the way you feel, nothing will change
The internet is not dangerous, the people behind the screens are.
I was happy about the Easter sales yesterday, Cinnabon was selling 4 packs for $10 yesterday though
@ilaurita Both from whatever gate of hell u wanna refer too lmao
I can't put on a front for Jesus because I don't believe in him
I'm glad that alot of people didn't sprinkle me with that happy Easter shit yesterday.
The world can't be changed, but I'll be damned if I don't.
I don't even try to understand the world anymore, I just accept it for place it is and try to enjoy little pieces of joy when I can.
There's a makeshift Suge Knight impersonating terrorizing the Midwest/East Coast on Facebook live, catch and kill this nigga yo.

I just love my alone time on weekends, I need this kind of time to just relax and get ready for a possible hectic work week.
@theehomieyari Zyrtec love, if that's too weak, Zyrtec D...thats what I use. It saves my asthmatic ads in these hard times lmao

Warm weather, city lights, good music; best believe I'm in my zone
Nights like this remind me of my favorite season, summer nights.
Day after day, the Trump administration is falling to pieces just like we knew it would.
@ilaurita #Lames lol
I refuse to support a company that makes light of a tremendous and ongoing struggle by appropriating it with a talentless jackass
Kinda sucks that I'll have to stop drinking Mountain Dews AMP'd drinks because they're of the Pepsi brand, but oh well.
And then they wonder why most people fuck with Coke brand...

2 deaths in one night, and that adds to a couple more from last week that we've treated and experienced; it's been rough.
Not fucking with Pizza Hut anymore, my stomach is all topsy turvy now lmao
@DDPirl thanks bro! #replylateasfuck
I mean, spiritually, God has me on a new wave
Heart full of gratitude, a head full of hope, and a pocket full of love.
@mad_d33 thanks love!!!
I'll be turning one on 7.25.2017, fucking awesome.
Nothing like a song that makes twist up my face and move my neck like it's broken with a rhythmic bounce

Expectations are premeditated resentments
Living life in comparison is deadly
@TheLyteFacedOne I appreciate that brother! I am too! Life ain't great now, but it's much improved.
I was afraid to face myself and really get honest about what was really bothering me
I internalized so much pain, disappointment and negative thinking that I projected it onto everything and everyone near and dear to me
All along, the problem was me; I was my own worst enemy.
Being broke all the time wasn't the problem
Not being in school wasn't the problem
Being single wasn't the problem
Not having a dope ass car wasn't the problem.
I thought that I had lost it all back in 2015 and that just pushed me deeper and deeper into my depression and addictions.
And these days I'm no longer afraid to ask for help
Except, two years ago it wasn't this fucking cold, and there certainly wasn't any fucking snow on the ground! Lol
I'm not glorifying a suicide attempt, I'm just acknowledging how happy I am to have been so lucky to keep on living.
@_JaySimms yes he is! All the time! I appreciate that!
@Glencocolaflare I appreciate that, and they certainly have, now my smile is pure.
I lied and said that the accident was because of a deer jumping out of nowhere, but that was all me
I wasn't ready to deal with life on life's terms.
I was ready to throw the towel in over little shit that I allowed to become big and defeat me spiritually and almost physically.
One thought of negativity, 3 shots of tequila, and 4 ambien equated to this, and I walked away from this and was pi https://t.co/liJJ4fNQ9v
On this very day two years again I had my first suicide attempt, but by the grace of God, I'm still here and happy to be here.
Somebody just told me that St. Patrick's Day is tomorrow, and in that moment my heart filled with absolute gratitude.
Not once was he asked who he was or asked to register to be seen by a doc
...then there was this Nigga who did the complete opposite and HAD to act a fool when he was asked to leave after sleeping for 9 hours.
I'm all for having homeless people spend the night in the ER waiting room, as long as they leave when it's time to and don't start any shit
My #WizKids play the Mavs tonight, lettuce ball
We need to find out how Korea overthrew their president, we the people need that kinda finesse.
Workplace relationships are messy as fuck bro
It's 21 fucking degrees bruh, last week it was like 60 something! Uggh
U wanna trade for this colder than a Republicans heart ass weather we're having over here?! https://t.co/RcSxUHeN3J
I gotta find a new plateau to show off my talents, I gotta get back in school.
I'm frustrated as fuck with how my shift just ended, I hate being the asshole, but it's like that sometimes *Frosty Shrug*
I'm just impressed that we're winning on the road, and against good teams...in close games!
I haven't been this excited about the Wizards in a long, long time!
DAGGER!!! #WIZKIDS https://t.co/Fz5vfZYAJh
@LawanVanida keep yo chin up! It comes and goes like the seasons for a reason https://t.co/Yh9GjGIKqQ

This Wizards comeback is fuckin ridiculous! *RZA voice* https://t.co/PC7KpTkJ48

"Maybe Donald Trump should give up the presidency for Lent"
@alexicais I might just bring her one when I ask her out to *nudge nudge* sweeten the the deal. Lmao https://t.co/hPF5QA6bNA
@alexicais yea I'll probably suggest something cooler lol
Rap beef these days is trash, I don't really care who's involved
I just hope she isn't an animal rights activist or something, but hey, I can suggest something else if she's now down for the circus lok
I might even dig up the courage to ask this girl out to the circus next month lol
Winning feels good, it's that simple.
And I get bigheaded when I win stuff, now I'm really about to show my ass and go even harder this quarter.
I used to look at God as a wicked fucker, an executioner, almost evil. But then I found out that MY God works through people, and it's great
And I wouldn't have been able to have realized or experienced any of that of it were not for my sobriety. I couldn't be more grateful.
You never know who's watching you, you never know what God has in store for your next opportunity.
I don't care what your job is, or how low on the totem pole you think you are, do your job with pride, dignity and class.
My job isn't the greatest, doesn't pay the greatest, and certainly not where I thought I would've landed, but man does it give me pride.
I love telling people about how their insurance works or relieving them of that sense of worry that I know they're gonna have.
The last thing I want a patient to feel when I encounter them, is feeling fearful about their medical expenses.
But I get a rise of helping people, by letting them know that we offer financial support and payment plans.
I will admit, it takes a special kinda charm to get money out of the pockets of sick and hurt people on a daily basis.
Management could've let me go after going to rehab twice in a year, but no. They stood beside me, believed in me, and pushed me to be great.
I started March off with a huge accomplish at work, in my department, and I'm just filled with gratitude right now.
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking about yourself less.

Hopefully my Wizards can pull a win out of tonight's game against OKC
And @cinnabon tweeted me! My week has been made! Love you guys! I miss working there so much!
Today has just been a blessing, got my rest, found a dope ass coffee shop on P Street NW and lead a fantastic meeting #blessingskeepfalling
I'm so hype for the Dodgeball tournament in Delaware on Saturday. That's guaranteed to be a great day! I get to ball and celebrate 7 months!

Bruh, I just looked at the 10 day forecast for the upcoming week, and I'm not one to jinx shit, but I will say this...I LOVE GLOBAL WARMING
And for the record, for everyone who made that ignorant ass girl saying cash me outside, go fuck yourselves
And we still effortlessly and creatively keep coming up with new shit because the world would be boring and lifeless without our innovations
Michelle Obama's speech, the go best friend that's my best friend video, everything in hip-hop, hairstyles, dances, everything...
But that's why we're so creative, we know our shit will get mimicked, copied, or stolen. Hollywood Divorce remains relevant to this day
The media will always replace a black man doing something positive and creative with a white person doing the same damn thing afterwards.

@fayzzeee I'll come thru!!! Where we eatin?!
Tom Brady can be the GOAT of the NFL, but never in sports overall. Can't whiteout  history, I'll be damned if that happens this month.
@Complex nope, MJ never lost a championship game and I've yet to see a pair of Brady's, just sayin...
That the difference between having a good team, then having a good team with LeBron on it, puts your chances of winning up exponentially.
LeBron misses a layup, then comes right back to hit the shot to tie the game which would eventually give his team the OT win, incredible.
That Wizards versus Cavs game last night was one for the record books in that rivalry.
So I can now add "served as a chaperone while a Kaiser doctor examined an elderly man's penis"...I swear I wish I could be making this up.
I'm so fucking happy for Ke$ha!!! She's free, now let's hear some more music...after she recovers and gets some help of course.
"Goddamn! Who turned her into Rick James?!" Lmao
So umm...red line...wtf is going on?! I just got off work and I feel like I'm late headed home lmao @unsuckdcmetro
Don't feed into the hatred, force love upon society.

It's something so authentic and intimate about having a conversation with someone without typing shit and using emojis. It's an art
I hate the pickup line, "can I text you sometime?" Nahh lemme call you when you're free. I wanna hear your voice, emotion, how was your day?
I'm a boring texter, but on the phone and in person I'm awesome as fuck!

@LauRenxExCarter given the events of chaos, madness, and overcrowding in my city right now, I'm pretty great lol how are u?
NO MEANS NO FELLAS! There is no reason at all a woman should be harassed, ridiculed, assaulted, raped, or killed because she's not into you.
Randomly fucking up stores takes away from the whole purpose of whatever it is you're fighting for, now it just looks savage and spiteful.
Fucking up Starbucks like the Macchiato ever done shit to yall...man y'all ain't shit lol
Take that same fire and fury up to Capitol Hill, go against the system you hate and take action there if you're so ballsy, not the stores.
I'm all for protests n shit, but smashing up places where innocent people, like you and I work isn't progressing shit, it just looks foolish
@iiBreakNecks @TimiaTooTrill see that's what I don't get, how is smashin up a place where people work gonna help with anything? this is dumb
@iiBreakNecks @TimiaTooTrill see that's what I don't get, how is smashin up a place where people work gonna help with anything? this is dumb

I remember I wrote off my life and prayed that I would be dead before my 30's, thank God for intervening and helping me get my mind right

6 months clean and serene on Wednesday!
All that extra money was just being squandered on supporting my drug and alcohol habit anyways, nothing productive.

Tomorrow we will have a white president for the first time in 8 whole years...fuck man...
The world will keep spinning, but this election has really made me question where we stand as a people and doubt humanity as a whole.
I like my vegetables to be actual fuckin vegetables, I don't like salt or butter or grease on my shits.
I just don't get it, why? This feels like the ultimate betrayal, and there's not ONE MLK quote that you can post that'll change that.
The only conversation that your performance is gonna open up is the confused white people in the audience asking "who's the black girl?"
You can't build a bridge with ignorance and assume that 15 minutes of fame is gonna open up a conversation...
The media is referring to you as another Do D-list celeb in the lineup, but in our community your talent is A-list quality...why?
I know it's HER choice to perform for this crooked demon of a man, but why? His entire being goes against everything you ever sang about...
How Chrisette just gonna pull a Stacey Dash on us though?
@LawanVanida that's me down to the science. I take a walk thru Georgetown to Dupont every Friday night lol
I'm def gonna swing by Stachowski's Market next Friday and pick up some delicious lookin cuts of steak, I've been craving one so bad lately.

I miss my homey tho...@UrMajesty131
So I met a member of @ballyhoorocks tonight, cool ass dude man, funny as shit too lol
That was back in 2008 when T-Pain, Ye and Weezy made it THE THING to do
I felt that conscious rappers don't use auto tune.
We split because we all had different views on auto tune, they loved it and I hated it.
We were a dope ass group though, Mic-K, TB it was lit we lived music, where'd it all go?
I remember back when I was Problem-C aka Tha Local MC Haha
My the planets of my minds universe are starting to align again, my brain's beginning to shine again, I'm starting to rhyme again...
WE ARE NOT OUR FUCKING GRANDPARENTS! WE WILL NOT TURN THE OTHER CHEEK! WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THE BULLSHIT!
I want everyone of the racists coming to DC thinking that they're gonna occupy our city and be bold with their words to remember...
@Addicted2ginger can I sing a song?
And I apologize to any woman that I was ever friends with and ultra nice to just to try and get in their pants, I too was a creep before.
The friend zone is creepy, she doesn't owe you shit. Fuck your hidden agenda, stop being a pretender, is they why you befriended her?

I'm wondering which amount of time do I tell them they should wait to go in after me. Should I tell em 15, 25, or 25-45 minutes? Lol
Now I gotta walk outta here after just unleashing the force with security and a bunch of nurses outside the door helping some poor soul

And if you are doing it to show the Internet what a "good person" you are then that's who you should be 24/7, 365, 366 in the leap year
@EriselCruz feel me tho?! It's not that hard
Help people from the goodness of your heart
Being a good and decent human being means doing the right thing without looking for a some sort of approval from society or pat on the back
I hate seeing people post pix and tweets about helping the homeless for likes and rounds of applause; that's what you're suppose to do

I don't wanna be the chaser, never have been, but that's not my style lol
I'm far to anxious and nervous to approach women in social settings unless it's through a friend or I get an opportunity to speak to em
I'm just hanging in, watching Bloodline and enjoying my own company
I'm so happy to see the snow and know that I don't really have anywhere I need to be lol

K Foos is the greatest man, thanks!!!
Got my home group meeting tonight, then afterwards a concert at the 930 Club to see Lettuce and TAUQ!!! I'm lit!!!
Saw my psychiatrist this morning and she was happy to hear of my progress and how hard I've been reppin her and the hood lol
If those are the worst things to happen to me today then I'm not having that bad of a day after all
Nope I'm still all good, smile on my face, hope in my heart; Ripped pants, busted headphones n all lol
You would think I'm having a bad day: 1st the left side of my headphones go out, then I ripped my pants at the meeting this morning...
Understanding rather than being understood. Listening rather than wanting to be heard, and giving rather than taking.
I'm gonna enjoy this year a clear headed and stress free dude, doing what I've been doing since I clean the last 5 months.
Progress not perfection people
I want a better me this year, but shit, that's something I should strive for everyday. Why live if not to progress each day of my life?
I want my friends to continue to grow and teach me of success and love through actions so I can become a better me
All I want to leave in 2016 is fear, loneliness, hopelessness, and depression.
I'm not for cutting people off just because a new year rolled around. The people I needed last year were there for me thru everything
No new friends, because my current friends are dope.
I'm not for the lame cliches for what I planned to leave in 2016. I don't want a new me, because I'm dope.
I am starting to feel like the person I was before my father passed back in 2002. I'm starting to get that sense of energy and self back
@xLawanV all of the racists are gonna come out of the woodwork and the circus will be in town lmao
@KingLouie8th it is so damn random but it's so honest and hilarious and pure lol
@iAmDrugzz Bloodline is pretty cool, I love the family drama and the suspense is cool

@LauRenxExCarter I love you Ren, like forreal!!!
But hey, at least I tried to do the right thing
I gave the Humane Society my contact info to let me know if they rescued the little dude, but I'm not sure if that'll be a good or bad thing
I'd hate to come home tomorrow and see that little dude all smashed into Michigan Ave lmao
I gotta get to work n shit, I just wanted to know that somebody could come and make sure this little raccoon doesn't end up as roadkill
Then the lady asked if I could trap it until a rescue crew came, I was like: https://t.co/fHTqdiZJyZ
"We actually just put them down when they come in" at that point I don't know if I helped the little fucker out or put their life in danger
So once I got through to somebody and told em about this limping baby raccoon, they said, "well we don't really rescue raccoons..."
So I Googled the number for the Humane Society in DC
The damn thing did start walking towards me, but I couldn't help but notice it's painful and awkward limp.
At first I thought it was gonna start chasing me or some shit...
My nigga instincts immediately kicked in and I got out of its path and went all the way around it, then the damn thing noticed me
So I was on my way to the station tonight before work, passing by Trinity U n shit, and I see this baby raccoon in the grass in front of me
#HTTR LET'S MAKE THE PLAYOFFS TODAY!!! https://t.co/ULxBztTGak

Waking up in @nashbegosh's place with the whole squad is exactly how I want to start off the last Saturday of this year.
I wanna finally travel this year too, the DMV is not my whole world. My personality is too big to be confined to one area.
The only thing I'm really looking forward to in 2017 is more opportunities for success, more growth, and serenity
@LauRenxExCarter oh hush!!! Lolz
I miss shorty so much, I hope she's getting the most out of her program and really trying at it this time around.
#In2016 I fell in love with someone without sexual contact
#In2016 I started holding myself accountable for my role in things, rather than blame others for my problems.
#In2016 I got comfortable with being uncomfortable and embraced changed rather than hide from it.
#In2016 I humbled myself to an exponential degree
#In2016 I found out that I don't need alcohol and drugs to have a good time or suppress my feelings, I'm actually pretty dope
#In2016 I found my inner child again, and let me tell you, I haven't felt this alive since 2002, when my father died.
#In2016 I found out the ones who are really there for me and the people who I don't need around anymore, but still have love for.
#In2016 I found out that I suffer from the disease of addiction, and instead of letting it consume me and quitting, I did something about it
2016 was shitty, pop culture wise, but for me it was an awesome journey.
I love my friends, they're so fucking awesome, so supportive, and so lit to life it's incredible!

I'm kinda sad because my shorty almost died, again. But in that same breath I'm happy that she's changed her location and got back to rehab
I don't talk about my sobriety to gloat, I do it because I'm still in awe at this fucking miracle and second chance I got. #GodsGrace
Blaming people for my issues, my shortcomings, and unhappiness got boring. Digging into my soul and finding my part in everything is dope
Damn Steve Francis you were one of people who made me proud to be from Silver Spring...hope he finds sobriety and his way eventually.
No time for hibernation, only elation.

I wore being depressed as a crown and allowed my anxiety to gain sympathy from people I didn't deserve it from.
I've been an ass to my family
I got circumcised at the age of 20 to please my girlfriend at the time because she didn't like little extra skin on the Wang.
I've driven drunk and put the lives of my passengers and other drivers in danger just to show I was good at driving drunk
I've finger-fucked my bank account and said fuck credit on many occasions
I've tried to turn a cold shoulder to women, then ran back like a bitch once I realized what I was pushing away
I've tossed up my middle fingers to work
In my alcoholism and addiction, I've done countless things to be accepted in certain situations.
Let go of your resentments. It's like peeing on yourself in public, nobody knows it but you lmao
I'm headed off to La La Land to count some sheep.

Rehab Reds is it a name or a part of the game? The highlight of my summer, my burning flame in summers sticky rain.

I won't deny your skills, talent, or successes, but I won't care for any of your shit anymore. Can't rock with it
If you're famous and let that money change your minds idea of what your skin color is, I can't support you.
I felt that fire and it was like, "hold on nigga, I'm about to make your young ass feel real old right quick!"
My God has a funny sense of humor, hit me with a mean dose of heartburn yesterday before I went to bed before work lmao
And it's crazy because this time next week, I'll be 4 months clean and sober!
...and some good music!
That's my open invitation to everybody! I just want to be around food and friends tonight, that's all.

It feels so good working 16 hours, falling asleep, and waking up to a Skins win! #HTTR!!!!
I just wanna be around some friends and good food, that's about it.
I have no idea what I'm doing for my birthday on Friday, and that's fine with me. I don't need a huge momentous occasion to celebrate life
Life ain't so bad
Take a moment out of the day to make a gratitude list for yourself just to remind you that there is always something to be grateful about.
I've survived 100% of my worst days, I'm not doing bad at all.
Saturday 16 today. I need strength!
Bruh what is this world coming to?! A baby drop-off?! Wtf?!
#FuckTrump bro
Marched in my first protest tonight down H street to 395, I've never been more proud of our diversity, never been more proud of the DMV

At least I voted, at least I tried. Better to have lost playing the game than to have been on the bleachers spectating and talking shit
So imma get thru this shift, accept the fuxtaposition our country just put itself in, pray for a better tomorrow, and watch Gotham.
@LauRenxExCarter yep uggh
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous. It's like that sometimes the shit ridiculous. It's like that sometimes, ridiculous
I'll be so happy when all of this is over...
Even if you don't agree or don't think that your vote counts, make it count for someone you know that wishes they could vote but can't.
...and tear families apart due to his own insecurities and racist beliefs. Not today #ivoted
...and I would hate to even fathom the idea that some idiot could potentially intrude upon their pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness
My vote today was for those can't vote but wish they had this opportunity. I have many friends whose parents still aren't citizens...
#iVoted https://t.co/xNnM6aZpzS
I'm just tryna go 3-0 in voting tomorrow, that's all I know.
@MD_Law_Diva heyy!!!! I've been all cool. How about yourself??
If you have keep one foot in yesterday, and another in tomorrow, you'll piss all over today. Stay in the moment, be present.
Don't quit before the miracle happens

That thought puzzles me.
Like, we're probably never gonna have sex again but, I've seen you naked.
Like, I saw you ass naked and now I'm looking at you again.... and I can't see you the same.
If you think about it, it's weird to be friends with someone you had sex with.

It's very funny to tell a prostitute "oh no I'm sorry I'm flattered but no thank you"
I was parked outside and texting, and she comes and walks up to the car and says "what do you need?"
So today a prostitute walks up to my car again by mistake. This has happened twice in a month
Actually I'm just gonna sit here and watch Friends.
I'm gonna go buy some beer.
Already in a desperate need of a cigarette on the first day of 2017.

@moonxhalo should it say "Insert here" with an arrow pointing to my butthole? I really feel like I should get that
@ashleydragulaa ass sounds like a better option, at least if I regret it, it's not on my face lmao
@moonxhalo I feel like that would look really cute on me....

I can't stop drinking.
I can't socialize with friends when I stop drinking.
She was just a space filler.
I guess I was always alone.
Now I'm alone.
I used to drink with someone I was in love with.
I'm tired of drinking by myself every night.
I guess go home would be the best option....

The wallet only had like $2 and my backpack had homework and pencils. (I never used pens bc I constantly fucked up)
One time when I was 11, I got robbed by some high schoolers for my backpack and my spider-man wallet.
I honestly love LA so much.
That was probably TOO much information so I'll prolly delete that

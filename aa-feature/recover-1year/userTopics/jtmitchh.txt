ive missed the ocean so much. so good to be home
i want to know what goes though someone's head that would make them buy a yellow car.
things I've done instead of my paper: make a TV guide so I can finally enjoy life
question of the night: how do pagers work?
i think he secretly understood that I'm a broke college student so every coupon counts.
thank you to the guy at dunks who couldn't figure out my coupon for just giving me the coffee for free.
HAPPY GAMEDAY HAWKS 
@AlxWllmsn i found that last night if you drink wine while writing it the ideas just flow
I JUST FINISHED MY SENIOR THESIS.
at the point where \"thesis is due in 8 days\" translates to \"drink a bottle of wine\"
@Netflixhelps yes i did thank you !
more importantly now I'll never know what happens on my show if Netflix won't work
my internet would quit out the minute i get everything for my thesis put together 
i was actually so tired and out of it today i almost left the drive through with my coffee but almost forgot my 15$ in change
might have to rewatch blue mountain state soon
the only thing we have to drink in our apartment is beer... a surplus of 150+ beers.
picnic #7 
today is a great day to be a hawk. #HAPPYPICNIC #HAPPYGAMEDAY

torn between spending the rest of my day doing work or just telling myself i have no work to do and binge watch the walking dead
pretty much where im at so far this year https://t.co/7Em13hs7nr
@SFoleyJr56 yeah we should probably get on that.. it's due in 8 days
upon finishing my thesis i will also be finishing a large amount of much needed alcohol &amp; not doing work for the remaining of the semester
you hit a new type of broke college student when you take tabasco sauce from chipotle and salt and pepper from restaurants

it takes a certain type of person to take leftover sushi home. and that type of person seems questionable.
after 52 days i am finally going home !
Microsoft Excel will be the reason why i want to throw my laptop out the window today.

the gunman looks like it's going to be a phenomenal movie
there's a certain pride that you feel when you see a squirrel safely make it across the road.
idk what's scarier.. Nancy giving tours or Nancy driving the cart that people willingly get on to take a tour.
this is turning into the two-three coffees a day kind of week.
to the person who left me flowers, a nip of jger and an I'm sorry note in my mailbox.. thank you...but who are you? http://t.co/eojZEti7EO

@cheechee_19 @EmPlourde basically how I'm feeling right now..
lol that SAC made me spend 1400$ on an online class over the summer just for me to find out in two classes ahead and was never behind...
found a sticker from a McDonald's toy stuck to me this morning so this weekend went smoothly.
today is a great day to be a hawk 
by the looks of my bank account Halloween is looking like a nice white sheet with a hole in it. 
when the patriots win, i win because i get free coffee. 
i can't wait to fall asleep to this thunderstorm 
just broke the news to mom about possible grad school in Denver.... needless to say she hasn't responded.
having to title the subject of all of my emails \"senior thesis\" really hits things where it hurts
just when i think ive gotten my life together...
@AndrewHerlihy thanks for the invite 
today would be the best beach day 
the plan of going to the gym has turned into going to a budweiser brewery tour.
HAPPY GAME-DAY HAWKS  #BeatSacredHeart
@MikeLombard85 
@COLINALLANGELS i would have done that but we only get one TV channel

living in K8 so far... no living room light.. no kitchen light... now RIP to the fridge... #greatjobsac

shoutout to the lady at Davison who shredded my ID that I've had since freshman year for no reason..... http://t.co/0J1RTcA7Nn
because it's 4:35 in the afternoon and what else is there to do besides pop open a bottle of champagne out your bedroom window.
why i drank two bottles of wine last night escapes me. feeling lucky that I'm not dying
the only thing i know is this \"drink the entire bottle of wine tonight\" hangover is going to bite me in the ass tomorrow at 8:30am...
waking up at 6:45 is really too fucking early
@cdooley728 that's what i said! haha.
@cdooley728 i will ! he's on the fence to see if it's worth it or to just trade it in for something that isn't known for lots of problems
@cdooley728 rear axle. black sludge and fluids were covering my brake pads and rotor so my dad has to fix it
@cdooley728 yeah this didn't make my dad happy and now he has to drive me tomorrow and that makes him more not excited haha
shoutout to Nissan for making a horrible 2010 xterra... 51k miles and its a piece of shit
on a good note this is my last day of work for the summer 
i actually apologized to the family of spiders for disturbing their living in my car since i haven't used it in a week
I've been \"packing\" for six days which is basically lets we how messy the apartment can get before the floor is no longer visible.
which caused me to burn my waffle so today just isn't fair
have tried to make coffee three times so far this morning, only to find i never put the coffee pod in the keurig..
only 44 more hours of five islands left  
why is it after a night of drinking tequila everything you drink the next day tastes like tequila...
@aaronmbarrett you were too busy organizing soaps!
@aaronmbarrett lmao yes... the cardboard ripped and they just went everywhere... i was just so upset haha
but the real mvp is the guy at the register who told me to go grab a 12 pack to replace the 6 that broke. so in reality i lucked out
pretty sure i heard someone clap for me, while i just stood there and felt like crying because there was undrank beer all over the floor.
everyone is at Walmart today. everyone also watched one of my six packs shatter all over the floor just after i paid for them. 
thank you for letting me to call you family for the sledding, hot chocolate, and agreeing with me that math sucks. rest in peace uncle tim.
sometimes you just have one of those days where one shower beer isn't enough...
@J_wood80 that's so soon... but at least I'll see ya soon!
i think it is somewhat terrifying that in 19 days i will be moving in for my last year of college... #SAC16
walked home yet again to realize i drove to work today. . you'd think this would only happen once..... but no...
this would make walking to class so much more fun... https://t.co/bmANJo8obC
@cdooley728 i wish i could say that i was surprised
Nancy's suggestions for a theme to our room so far...\n1. Frozen \n2. Disney
what's there to do when you can't sleep besides search for dogs to adopt...
the 50 Shades of Grey wine is sexier than the actress who played in the movie
upta' camp 
but shoutout to Dave for driving to town at 1:30 this morning to pick us up. #therealmvp
but then again i drank at least six different kinds of alcohol and beer throughout the night so i had a right to look disheveled.
no one told me that i was dressed like a homeless blind middle-schooler today.
i look rugged as fuck walking through the mall today.

@_foxyoxley it gets interesting but it's all just very sad. it makes me want to get my life together but at the same time just be sad

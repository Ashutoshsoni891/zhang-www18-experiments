People who talk about getting fucked up doing drugs and drinking just want attention subconsciously or consciously

@badkass happy thanks giving kass hope you have a great one and anytime you wanna talk just give me a shout
@badkass YES! LIVE out of GODS will not SELF will! We as humans tend to remember the negative things instead of all the positive things
@badkass sometimes you just gotta sit back and take a minute to realize how good you really have it so you take nothing for granted.
The worst part is I love being home but it's absolutely the worst place for me to be
Speaking in front of 100's of people for what I'm great full for and the journey of my life was probably one of the best things ever!
Feeling voids in your life with drugs and alcohol won't help...if you can't truly love yourself for who you are then you can't love others

Couldn't ask for a better life. Living in Greensboro away from all the stupid bullshit.

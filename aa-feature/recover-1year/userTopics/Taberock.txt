@BBCWorld @BBCNews look at the history of the areas and airlines of all other intentional crashes????
@SteveConteNYC yea.  Gonna try for Bowery elec
@hannahjames40 cheers. !!!
@hannahjames40 yea.   Sounds like better background checks but mental illness is a very scary thing to detect.   Sounds like it could be
@hannahjames40 lol mate
@hannahjames40 @SouthwestAir said Wrong.  Fly as passenger.   Lol
I don't know where Ya got that.  I only fly as a passenger.   Must have said it wrong.     Sad day none the less
@hannahjames40 I'm not a pilot
@hannahjames40 just protocol I guess but they haven't ever had an issue
@hannahjames40 it will cost all of us!   I fly @SouthwestAir  all the time.  They block off cockpit area and flight attendant goes in
@hannahjames40 true!  Or bathroom as well.   But this was a short flight.
@hannahjames40 @BBCWorld agreed.    But if a flight attendant was inside  and they block off the cockpit enterance off like the do here
@BBCWorld one other crew member should always be in the cockpit.   Standard procedure in the US

@drsanjaygupta I don't believe there was any med emergency. I respect you but this is too fishy
@andersoncooper can u ask.  Any international flight I've been on usually another cabin crew member goes in cockpit when that happens

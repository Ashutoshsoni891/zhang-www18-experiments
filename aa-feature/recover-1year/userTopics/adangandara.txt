Ok lets get one thing straight, get out my land!
@natalieruff3 please do, I watch it
@natalieruff3 what happened! I missed it!
@Lexx0721 you and me know they do sister .., I miss you
Some times I just need to let my feelings be #onelesstornado
@TheGarrettFaber c
@jessiemunno not a bad option
@TheGarrettFaber C
@AJR666 fuck off
@zpeck68 Stop it!
@AJR666 @zpeck68 Oakland would love to have a lot of players and they didn't take it when they had the chance!!
A
@zpeck68 It's definitely going to be interesting, hopefully he stays for that fact because he is the best runstopping DT right now
@zpeck68 having 3-4 years left and he's a great run stopper which makes the secondary's job a lot easier
@zpeck68 sucks and hope they can work it out but NE can't afford to have the team fall apart without them planning it out with Brady only
@wilfork75 please don't leave...
@itsCASH hahaha
Drinkin beers and listening to LeDoux is exactly how I'm spending this Wednesday afternoon
@zpeck68 John Elway is in it to win it this year cause you got a lot of important FA to worry about next season
@zpeck68 definitely not 4/5 years friend you forget that Talib is only good for half a season and Ware is bound to slow down
@zpeck68 *think
@zpeck68 no exactly young and durable besides TJ ... Which honestly is a damn good signing I thing
@zpeck68 Ward was a great pick up for how much they got him but Ware and Talib for pretty much 10 mil each? Elway is getting desperate
@zpeck68 these free agent signings look good from these last two years but they're so fucked with cap space for the next two years
@ashley_spatz I think it is, all we're is talkin about is future contracts #Psssshhhh
@ashley_spatz he left last spring!
Anyone wanna go to Ag Economics for me today? #please
@CaryLaine do I get a follow back?
Looks like I'm staying in Wyoming #MySweetWyomingHome
@BostonsFuture @Patriots I think it would make a lot of sense if we traded Amendola and a draft pick (5-7) for Smith
@BostonsFuture I think we're a SB team either way but we'll need at least two of them to be Super Bowl Champs @Patriots
Great cornerback, deep threat receiver, and @Edelman11 is all I want for free agency @Patriots @nfl #NFLFreeAgency
@ElsnerAbby happy b day!
@zpeck68 that explains a lot
9 years today since the greatest cowboy country singer died #godblessChrisLeDoux http://t.co/lTujth2v6B
Happy birthday Lily Bug! http://t.co/yiNltF2be7
Weird to say but I miss @Lexx0721
@tacojohns it's okay, just had a Santa Fe burrito #cantbeatit
Fiddlesticks, I missed out on $2 breakfast burritos @tacojohns
Is today nice enough for shorts? #wyoweather
@CaryLaine #teamBlake but #WyomingFamily comes first #goodluck
Holy snow
Apparently people watch feet more than I realized after everyone was surprised I'm wearing tennis shoes today instead of boots
Bimbo bimbo where you gonna goio, bimbo bimbo whatcha gonna doio

Advice from a Marine: Fuck it @herringtontw
Copenhagen &gt; life
@herringtontw is Ronald Reagan liberal?
@caseyrpeterson meh
\"@UberFacts  The eldest children in families tend to develop higher IQs than their siblings\" @Lexx0721 soooo true haha
@CauseWereGuys @Rem_140 let's just definitely not take the democratic answer
@C_T_hawk shit did I spell redickulus right?
@FrankiStokes the shortest named \"war\" in the United States was in Johnson County, Wyoming and it only lasted a week
I'm so bad with grammar it's ridiculous
I'm in a rut .. someone pull me out of it
Fuck, fuck, fuck,..... FUCK
@herringtontw and them were probably only the butch ones, probably missed all the hot ones
@herringtontw startin to turn into a liberal world
If you don't like LeDoux music, I don't like you
Heaven help me honey, I ain't changing my ways
@Lexx0721 sadly no :/
That Bull knew he was gonna lose haha
lets go tyler
@natalieruff3 on positive news, you and I don't know the Superbowl champ yet :) #AnyGivenSunday
@natalieruff3 what should really suck for you is the amount of talent Denver has compared to New England and possibly being #2 seed now
@natalieruff3 I bet! lol
@zpeck68 ok bud let me see, we might put a good team together
@natalieruff3 love you by the way
@zpeck68 maybe why?
That ride was nuts
sucks to go against Chet, but go Wade and Heith #Saddlebronc
Lets go Heith!
Atta boy Kaycee #WranglerNFR
I love @gactv for rerunning the finals for people who work haha #WranglerNFR

@amberveehill ... Boston and support the local @Patriots
@saul_0110 you too bud, have a good senior year
@saul_0110 I understand bud, but anyways man hit me up sometime when the weather ain't so shitty
@saul_0110 yeah it would man, hell you'll probably be getting out of Cheyenne anyways after this year im betting
@2525sds ahh ok haha
@saul_0110 you goin to college for a sport?
@saul_0110 Yeah it was, heard your name and dillons and I looked at the tv and it was you guys on varsity football, I felt old haha
@2525sds hmmmm I see
@saul_0110 enjoying my college years haha, saw you on the news a few weeks back and was like shit, I haven't talked to that kid in forever
@saul_0110 sup bud how've you been
@2525sds no longer blonde
@2525sds Your names a lie now
@caseyrpeterson you only think I did
@casey_renee92 so how bout them Red Wings
@caseyrpeterson is proof that a women can turn a conversation around on you in a heart beat and make you feel like an ass #evil
@casey_renee92 dug myself a hole huh
@casey_renee92 I wasn't to far off from my statement then
@casey_renee92 bet you got fat haha
Oh the Giants and Redskins are playing didn't know that
@AMCTalkingDead is the Governor really dead??? HOPEFULLY, HE KILLED HERSHAL!!! #WalkingDead
Nevermind
why the hell did she leave the governor to live!!!
F you governor!!!!! Can't believe they killed off Hershel :( HOPE YOU ROT IN HELL!
Manning is unstoppable, gah I hate him
@jenny_craig3 you're so nasty
Avery ... DIE
So much for the best Defense in the league haha pathetic
It'd be nice if these damn KC receivers could catch
@LandonLerwick your my friend
I love Manning INT's almost as much as I love a Brady TD
Alex Smith just pisses me off, there are receivers running open down field but he throws it short, and then he throws an INT in the endzone
Alex Smith sucks!
If @HoustonTexans get rid of @casekeenum7 in the offseason, come to @Patriots and learn to be our future QB #beast
Great game, good job Texans, Two minutes left and the Pats only need one first down to win
31 to 31 again? damn
Touch .... down ... WOOOO
@C_ramos111 they weren't even great movies #justsayin
That was ridiculous
I like Case Keenum and what he's doin, but sorry that sack and INT was awesome
INTERCEPTION!
10 to 0 Houston ... not worried #Pats #TomTerrific
@caseyrpeterson oh ..... go Patriots!
@caseyrpeterson Cause you are??
@caseyrpeterson go Lions!
killin time #gethammered
@RodneyAtkins You better be making your way back to @CheFrontierDays this summer!
Crap, New England is down 24-0 .. hopefully they make a comeback ... #NFLReplay
@caseyrpeterson good luck :) sorry I haven't been texting back, you usually been texting me on my drunk nights or hangover mornings :) haha
@caseyrpeterson let's see the damage college did
I need motivation to do something today
@zpeck68 I almost was
@_ariellove and they pulled through haha
that was unexpected
I cant even get on the NFL website right now just cause fuckin Cams face is plastered everywhere .. classless fuck
@MarissaBercier Not gonna lie I hope the Jets and Dolphins steamroll those fuckers im so pissed right now
@MarissaBercier huh?
@AaronRodgers12  at least you'd got screwed out of a game by replacements, these are pro refs that fucked the pats over
@nflcommish for primetime games, hire better refs ... Like Brady said at the end of the game .. \"That was fucked up\"
I don't care what anyone says, fuckin Kuechly held Gronk and that was straight up pass interference .. THEM STUPID FUCKS
@zpeck68 @ShooterMcGavin_ even in my rage mode right now.. I laughed at that
@NFL even the replacement refs could have gotten that one right
God I want to punch a small child right now ... You stupid ass ref
FUCK THE REFS FUCK THE NFL FUCK YOU CAM THAT WAS COMPLETE AND UTTER BULLSHIT
McCourty tryin to pull a Lebron ... Dumbass
THE GRONK
@SheasboRoo #DurfStrong til I die @SpencerDurfee
Stupid Solder and Ridley
Roger Goodell decided to rename \"a fumble\" to \"a Ridley\"
FUCK YOU RIDLEY! ... this is probably my most repetitive tweet ever
@C_T_hawk have you ever wondered the NFL keeps track of all these records?
Come on Brady, and Solder I know you're from Colorado but quit fucking up #cmonman
@C_T_hawk How'd I know you'd troll around my twitter tonight
Just start already Monday night football #Pats
@FrankiStokes oh thank you sensei
@FrankiStokes If you keep your nose out of other peoples shit then it wouldn't matter ... you have nice hair tho ... like that?
@DallieForkner bye
Anybody wanna go booze tonight?
Filterless is the best word to describe me
Well first day working for corporate America
My laptop is acting up ... Im gonna have to tell the evil monkey in my closet to quit goin on pornsites
I wish George Jones was still alive so he could sing me Finally Friday #Possum
@Ally_OBrien The last decent song I've heard is Point at You, but Blake's albums are really good, just not a fan of his singles, like BRH
@Ally_OBrien Don't get me wrong I like Blake, but all these recent songs by country artists make country people sound shallow and dumb
#np real country music #Garth #KingGeorge #Possum #AlanJackson #LeDoux #Shania #Clint #Kershaw #MichaelPeterson #TracyByrd #CDB #Willie
Hope you guys enjoy your \"country\" music awards tonight, nothing but shallow artists and over used lyrics with the same crap themes
Took my first drug test today #awesome #passed
@k_dizzle93 mostly a mess, it's only a hot mess when Big Ben finds a drunk girl at the bar .... haha sorry had to get that out
@k_dizzle93 or your embarrassed about the Steelers
Case Keenum holds most NCAA career stats and yet people still doubted him going into the NFL #attaboy #Keenum
@FinsUpAP don't need it here either! haha
@FrankiStokes words I never thought would be typed up #wow
I don't care how redneck you are the Rebel flag is a South thing don't go prancing around Wyoming saying it's who you are #haha
@k_dizzle93 :)
@k_dizzle93 WOOOOOOO!!!!! 81 yards :)
Edelman! God bless
Horrible flash backs today of the Pats defenses in the last 4 seasons
@MarissaBercier Mine used to be Mike Glennon so I feel your pain haha #ImADummy I feel bad I didn't start Brady this game
@MarissaBercier Not gonna lie I benched Brady for Nick Foles and its paying off big haha
Big Ben throws a big drop #Pats
If I lasted in bed as long as the Patriots offense stays on the field, I quite frankly would never satisfy a women
@C_ramos111 haha wtf man haha
Hoka Hey Lakotas
some peoples cats ... don't know which way to go when you try to avoid em on the road #roadkill
@getskunked B Light and Crown!

@RossJoditoadi16 Hopefully I'm hungry
#flyinghighoncaffineNcopenhagen
I'm not much of a relationship guy at all but man I sure let a great girl go because of pride #sadAdan #needcoffeeNcopenhagen
@TennesseeTitans @nfl  If there was anybody the lived the dream and ended it right, it was Bud Adams

@justBeHALL Ok just don't kill anyone  or break your back now
@justBeHALL make it rain in memory of the dude in prison, btw don't wear 85 it seems to be cursed on the Pats ... Hernandez, Johnson, Lloyd
@justBeHALL might as well, if Brady pulls off an 11-5 season with you at tight end we might as well crown him as the GOAT
@casey_renee92 what town is that??
@AaronHernandez well guy idk of you did anything wrong but I'm pulling for ya
@casey_renee92 Flint and Detroit rank 1 and 2 for most violent cities in America ... get out ta there!!!

@natalieruff3 But if you love the Patriots #follow @adangandara, Patriot post after post, with a dash of Brady greatness
@NRienks #TropicalCitrus
@h0neybunz_ that's clever #nosarcasm
If you use the term \"hater\" regularly, you're a douche #factonfact

#brightside Tom Brady still has more rings than LeBron @zpeck68
@C_T_hawk also hard to move after my back surgery
@C_T_hawk I cant take it off cuz Im trying to wash the blood off my welker jersey cuz I shot a dude in the face and my forearm is broken too
@natalieruff3 I hate it so much I actually like Manning a little more
@C_T_hawk Guess you need to return your Spurs gear now since Miami keeps winning huh
@aribjorkquist13 I wish I could call people out but I don't know their real intentions so I'll stay quiet
@natalieruff3 its basketball #whothehellcares
Can't tell if people use social media prayers for attention or cause they really care ... for most people its the first one sadly
@oliviahhhh a smartass mom? Intriguing ...  haha
@oliviahhhh either way hopefully she likes me for tweeting you #man
\"@hdeezymysheezt: No class, no taste, no shirt and shitfaced! \" that's me all the way and you know it mister
@oliviahhhh what does she have to saying about a male tweeting you then #ponderthat
I can't wait til @blakeshelton \"Boys 'Round Here\" gets annoying cause its just too damn catchy right now
@Romsa_Legend well they probably just made it a single cause they played it 5 times here between 2 stations #shootme
@Romsa_Legend love me like Jesus does or somethin like that
I really rather listen to Taylor Swift right now than Eric Church's new single #playedtoomuch
\"@TomBradysEgo: Heat fans have already pre-ordered their Spurs championship gear just in case.\" Clever @zpeck68 #bandwagoners

@caseyrpeterson visit family
@caseyrpeterson it's not irrelevant because if 50 people out of 100 died its 50% (Wyo) and if 50 out of 1000 died its 5% (Mich) example
@caseyrpeterson there inflated cause we only have a population lower than 700,000
@caseyrpeterson thats why Cheyenne is calling your name
@livviexo idk about that, even a blind dog finds a bone once in a while
I'll give Iowa this, it sure brought us a beautiful day! @livviexo

\"Idk. Motherfuckers need to be more like me get drunk use no book and just go from the head\" - Draft strategy of champion @slingblade6925
Taken from the Book of Commish, 3:16 \"If you don't pay, your ass don't play.\" See you all on draft day.
@LeagueOfGains_ that's odd, so is ours!
BREAKING: @LeagueOfGains_: @McClusterfucks @tyler94acosta draft is off McClusterfucks will go on as planned.
@LeagueOfGains_ @tyler94acosta joint would imply we were cooperating. That's false. Please don't contact our office any more.
@LeagueOfGains_ @tyler94acosta it's not a joint draft. Don't believe the bullshit. It's simple being held at the same facility.
Draft date has been set for August 15th. Usual place and roughly the same start time. (Our draft is in no way affiliated with any other)
Just kidding, I'm a fucking liar.
League announcement to be made within the week. Stay tuned.

Welcome new McClusterfuck members PR Manager @GregRaynal and Mr. Unknown, Mr. Wild card @Seth06355633
BREAKING: The Draft order has been set! To be revealed Thursday night.
@mrod504 zero. Sorry. Spots filled.
ATTENTION: A joint draft will be taking place with @LeagueOfGains_ this season. Stay tuned for details.
However, our good name will not be drug around in the mud like a Tonka truck. Again, disregard any statements made by said opponent.
Notice: Nothing the League of Gains says can be taken seriously. Ongoing disputes between their league and ours are just that - ongoing.
Lions don't concern themselves with the opinions of lambs.

LET THIS SINK IN. DIRECT QUOTE FROM MR. MANDELLA http://t.co/IZh7AHaYoB
This has escalated too far. @GainsMandella will be blocked for 12 hours.
@GainsMandella @ScottMigliore9 @PedroYoungblood sent it to me
George is just mad that a mass snapchat was sent of him making love to himself in the shower.
@GainsMandella @Ryan_Bourgeois why would it matter if he tweeted from a personal account? That's why we have multiple, dumbass!
@Double_E72 @GainsMandella calm down. There is no reason for impeachment
We would also like you to know that he was caught masturbating on spring break by @ScottMigliore9
The league would like you to know that george Mandella is a piece of shit
@GainsMandella your comments still fall under slander
@GainsMandella as of right now, your conducts fall in the legal realm of defamation and slander. You can be sued
@GainsMandella impeachment is a very strong accusation. There must be evidence for these statements
@GainsMandella you are to be blocked from the league's twitter shortly. Please fall in line with the league's conduct policy.
League Right Now http://t.co/phxaY0tDAE
@scanseco42 you are walking a tight rope
@scanseco42 please wastage the commissioner. Evidence will only be accepted if it can be authenticated.
@scanseco42 there has been no evidence of that Mr. Canseco.
Evidence to prove that Mr. Couture deserved his warning. http://t.co/RderUWHB4F
@slingblade6925 you signed the constitution, you knew what was and was not accepted.
@slingblade6925 his is true. But it doesn't dive into the realm of point shaving

***MESSAGE COMING FROM THE COMMISSIONER AT TOP OF THE HOUR****
@mrod504 all teams are under investigation. Thank you for your concern. It will be noted.
We believe the league to be running smoothly. Since we are on the horizon of the playoffs, it is a good time to ensure everything is well.
As is common practice, we will begin random checks and investigations into every team. This is just a normal function of our front office.
Any violation of League Conduct Policy is punishable by a suspension of no more than one postseason ban.
First &amp; foremost, all games will be fair. Meaning, there will be no insider tips, bribes, point shaving, or falsely setting another's lineup
In light of Mr. Canseco's situation and the NFL's current fragile nature, McClusterfucks would like to remind you of league conduct policy.
@scanseco42: The bidding starts at 5 dollars for McCoy of which the league will take 3 dollars for processing fees.
Another low week for the Village Fuck-Up. Better luck next season! http://t.co/1TTrDZKwCn
@PFTCommenter would you get injured tho? Theirs a difference
@slingblade6925 Comeback city? Or will you continue to get your dick kicked in? http://t.co/OM15v2xtwu
What if I told you, one queer changed Fantasy Football? #30For30
Just tried to follow @scanseco42's lead and get in touch with my feminine side.... It was gay as hell. Didn't like it one bit.
Hey Fuckheads. Someone pick up Prater
@scanseco42 you have to blow someone first
Most previous tweet is directly from PR Department
@scanseco42, I swear to God.. If your sex tape leaks.... I will lose my shit. If I see your naked ass, you better be hitting Selena Gomez
Official League Statement #McClusterfucks http://t.co/tBqIkUqGhh
Commissioner statement coming at top of the hour.
@scanseco42 have you sucked a dick yet?
Remember: Under the Drug Policy, Date Rape Drugs are only legal if you knowingly take them.
Breaking: @scanseco42 leaving team facility http://t.co/7h9vQcgfb9
Fuck Michael Sam, we've got the first openly gay player in McClusterfucks history!
By Rule 1.2 Section 4, that Willis be legal trade. It reads \"Sexual favors will be acceptable form of trade.\"
Uhmm... http://t.co/ip8zldYl4a
@GainsMandella bidding will take place over the course of three rounds, with the Commish dictating terms of sale.
Saints are in business once Brees retires IMO  Ryan Griffin seems hard-nosed if u no what I mean @PFTCommenter http://t.co/iKT49WqjIY
@PFTCommenter I care less than u
@PFTCommenter great read but you forgot to mention that men should start training there swimmers to be quick 2
@Ryan_Bourgeois I'll be sleeping. Goodluck getting everyone awake
@Ryan_Bourgeois I am in the Public Relations Union
Ryan wants to fire me because his fantasy team sucks today. Makes sense right?
@Ryan_Bourgeois I'll call my union rep. That's unlawful grounds for firing.
@Ryan_Bourgeois NEVEEERRRRRR
Everyone ask @Ryan_Bourgeois how fantasy football is treating him.
Beautiful day for some football. Happy scoring.
@PFTCommenter tbh it looked horrible. I usually just stick to mad dog on Thursdays
@slingblade6925 makes sense.
@slingblade6925 literally had nothing to do with saints
@PFTCommenter the grittiest ones can push bodily needs aside with real determination
@PFTCommenter: #GoBrowns http://t.co/A9uRJ6ChTU @slingblade6925
@Ryan_Bourgeois eat my ass.
@Ryan_Bourgeois eat my ass
@Ryan_Bourgeois nope. Eat my ass
@Ryan_Bourgeois Ryan Fitzpatrick, gherhart, Woodhead, jordy, welker, that's a gritty team rift there
@Ryan_Bourgeois it's about drafting an all white fantasy team. People don't try to win the right way
@Ryan_Bourgeois he has no eyes then
\"We don't see color; we see grit and lunch pales\"
\"We don't see color; we see grit and lunch pales\"
@STcommenter @PFTCommenter  his grammar saves lifes. If you can't handle strong taeks. The account. is not recommended. Theirs the door

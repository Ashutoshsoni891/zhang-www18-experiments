being stable is crucial when trying to involve another person in the chaos that is your mind
If you tell your potential boyfriend/girlfriend that you have a mental illness and they respond poorly, that person sucks

I've been in the depths of sound cloud and YouTube looking for new music
Yo it's 4:08 am, why am I up ???
Just like to remind Twitter that my ass is amazing with or without these pants https://t.co/HWl7JpNwp2
@TinyHeiny one time I got famous for a minute and that was pretty sick
Reasons why I'm a walking trash can: my purse and pockets are filled with clock out receipts and cigarette butts
@TinyHeiny I ask myself that question every day
Hey friends, stop telling me about the sex that I'm not having too, I get it.
Real talk: would it be sad to play a board game by yourself?
On a real level though, how do you make new friends as an adult?
I texted my friend asking what she was doing. Her response, \"having sex\"\nMe: oh okay bye
I'm fucking over it
Everyone come into mod and buy pizza from me
@yalilnastyyy I always get full bc waist trainer
Two slices at mod is half a pizza guys
I just ate two slices of pizza and I'm still hungry what's wrong with me
On my tombstone it's gonna say: will you cover my shift?
When no one will cover your shift but you sprained your ankle and can't walk
Sprained my ankle and when I asked my boss what to do, she got upset and told me if I can't come in I have to get my shift covered
\"I'll be home by 2 at the latest\" HAHA
This whole week I will be tweeting about Cara not coming home at the promised time

I asked Cara where she was and she told me she was lost in Huntington Beach and then her phone died
Friends, can we please do something tonight, I've been indoors all week
They use butane lighters

Some guy walked into my room the other day and kept calling me a hippy and that statement couldn't be more untrue but I'm flattered
Thanks Kanye
My life is dope, and I do dope shit
@zachthesack1 this is too dope
hour of yoga and quick workout, I'm so stretched out.
@razeaydakota comedic genius
Steve carell, man.
@zachthesack1 tfti
I just fell down the stairs
No one ever answers my texts but it's okay because I'll just pretend they did
Girls are crazy
@mrlspeed it's literally my screensaver
Honestly, probably a lot
I wonder how many times I've been cheated on and didn't know
I forgot that I worked out AND did yoga today, good job natasha
my whole clothes rack fell over and broke my lamp, it's been a chill day
These are some pics of my best friend ok https://t.co/qQqQ2AJtkx
My friend just sent me a snapchat of him and dj Khaled

@yalilnastyyy ily
Guys https://t.co/NFF4p0Ne2M
@yalilnastyyy when ivy has the hottest body of all time
well from alcohol
9 days sober
day 1- I accept
I was in the middle of yoga when my roommate stomps up the stairs and slams her door, namaste to you too
I ate eggrolls for breakfast
I think I need to get rid of social media
My roommate just got home six hours early and my mood just went to shit
You are not a burden
I cannot stress to you the importance of making friends who understand you and try to bring you up
How my friends view being thin is the perfect example of girls views on body image being skewed
I would break up with him in a second  https://t.co/FUjxFJWx2A
I know all of you are excited about the downpour and thunderstorms, but I have to ride my bike to work, I am not excited
You will be worth it to someone, I promise.
But if you happen to come across people who just want to use you, I hope you know when to walk away.
I hope you meet the right people in 2016, those who will appreciate you and wont take you for granted.
the first step to moving forward is admitting that you've been standing still
if you don't wanna suffer, then you better run
if you value your life, stay off the drugs\nif you value the drugs, stay off the map\nif you value them maps, you better travel soon
dipped my heart and hands in honey
stop giving yourself to people who don't deserve any ounce of you
Don't care about coachella. Is shakey graves playing? No. Is sylvan esso playing? No.
My heart hurts
Well I supposed to an aa meeting at 7:30 and then I looked out my window and thought, there's no way I'll survive on my bike out there
Just want someone to lay next to me and listen to shakey graves
Correction : flirted with me
I'll never forget the day shakey spoke to me
https://t.co/wvLhx7k6rT
I FIXED IT GUYS
I'm just trying to get all my music on my computer to my phone but icloud library just won't let me, fuck you apple
@zachthesack1 lol same
@yalilnastyyy I found him on his audiotree performances on youtube
@yalilnastyyy false
all shakey grave's songs are my favorite songs
@nicolebautitsta Nicole my god
@nicolebautitsta well, let's see it
you wake up 35 with a child and a bride
yo, glass animals and joey bada$$ have a new song together
wear pretty underwear and feel okay
update: my lip is swollen again
Update: took a shower, don't feel new. But I do feel clean
man this has been the worst life of my life
Someone come over and smoke cigarettes with me until I feel alive again
Let's be friends though
I'm going to shower and hope that I come out a new person
Looking back at the last month, I have made some real regrettable decisions
Yo I'm over having friends that are so far away
Took a nap to feel better and I woke up and felt worse. Well, I tried
Woke up, checked Twitter, and I'm over it
Don't be so offended that I deleted your number, I'm nothing to you ?
where are my friends when I eed them
@chris_calderonn I better be invited to your birthday celebration 
@chris_calderonn my bb is gonna be legal
Can someone sage my life please
I feel fried out
I can't tell u the misery it is to walk up a hill in the sun
I'll have my own car in a few weeks so that's pretty cool
@Dory @madgrimm1er
All my friends are back in San Francisco and I don't really know what to do with my time anymore
My mom bought me boots that didn't fit and this is what I exchanged them for https://t.co/qQQ4LGgSwn

@ambersbitchin she knows you did acid
amber was halfway out my window blowing out smoke, I grab around her waist, hold her, and say, Big baby
I would just like to inform the twitter sphere that I don't care about football
\"but just to make sure, we arent going to get in trouble\"
when Siberian Husky plays gently with baby gives you a bad trip
watching a video called Siberian Husky plays gently with baby and amber goes, \"I dont like that\"
when amber is having a bad trip
when amber keeps trying to go to the darkside and your safe word is \"bad trip bad trip bad trip\"
what
amber: do you see them?\nme: see who?\namber: the candles, they are going to runaway
*watching a video about kwanzaa*\namber: is that what carly celebrates?\n\n.......
There's this other Natasha I met at Xxyyxx and I genuinely feel bad for her as a person
https://t.co/xHTFUplPbw
My acid trip is like enhanced right now
I'm so annoyed
@jeensprout yeah of course I do
@jeensprout no I threw it away
Xxyyxx for the second year in a row with my best friend
@cababexo as you should be
Xxyyxx tonight
Walking my bike up the hill is almost just as bad
I refuse to ride my broken bike with no gears up this hill without my inhaler. I'm fucking walking
I'm really sick of makeup https://t.co/cw2thj9EZs
@chris_calderonn same
You do not need to be posting six snapchat videos of you and your boyfriend with your tongue down each others throats
You got laid last night, we fucking get it
We get it, you had a New Years kiss
If I see any more videos of people having their New Years kiss I will scream
@chris_calderonn 
@chris_calderonn HAHA ALCOHOL
Pls https://t.co/4RG2VbT7tx
I am up
It is five am
I am laying in bed and I start hearing a robot speaking, then amber says, \"I have to do my fifteen minutes of Spanish\"
E is a weird drug, man
rolls
Amber has now gone upstairs to console a crying teenager and I am in the kitchen charging my phone
Amber made us uber here and now I can't drive home
Take me home
\"*talking about ecig juice* I was telling them how I like to put it on my tongue and it makes me numb\"
\"This is what I feel like doing *rolls around her eyes* \"
\"I've always wanted to be a Pegasus\"
Live tweeting Amber on xanax
I'm over New Years and I've only been out for 5 minutes
@mrlspeed I just realized I had a problem and it had nothing to do with New Years 
If anyone needs a sober driver tonight and can't drive their own car home, I will be available to help you out! Stay safe everyone!!
Three hours and twenty minutes until my shift is over and I become my friend's personal uber driver for the night
First meeting went well
I'm up
@chris_calderonn tell me how yours is after
@chris_calderonn soooo far
@chris_calderonn where da heck is yours
@chris_calderonn idk, is it the one on Garfield and beach?
@chris_calderonn wait really
So my first AA meeting is tomorrow morning at 6 am

Some of you sabotage yourselves on FPL, like someone will just go Captain a centre back. Stop fucking around and Captain either Ibra or Kun
Scored better than last week, but I still feel like this was a shitty GW

Anyway, 29 point between two players, Ibra 20 and Shaw 9. Looking forward to a great GW again.
@Supremo0730 once Mkhitaryan is fully fit Mata will prolly start on the bench but that's after GW5 or so
If you are going to buy united players for your FPL team:\nDe Gea, Bailly, Shaw,Pogba, Ibra are your players until GW 5
It's Childish not to have this striking trio in your FPL team:\n\nNegredo,Ibrahimovic, Aguero\n\n@ me sunday to see if I'm lying

@Supremo0730 we just have to find each other as black people and love each other. \n:)
@Supremo0730 In a situation, where you are hated for nothing. That is a status quo that will never change.
@Supremo0730 the thing is if someone hates you for something. That thing can always be shifted. N the other person can learn to \"unhate\" you
@Supremo0730 especially through a song.
If as black people, we are to be real with ourselves(which is part of self-love), we are never going to hear the end of racism.

Hw do u single out members of the ANC n those who aren't in a protest? Do people go 2 protest with membership cards? https://t.co/DVFH7Djfkk
There are people who are power hungry, who pay people in protests to cause all sorts of anarchy. 
@BusiMkhumbuzi @Allan_Tshuma unfortunately, at the time of protest the mine workers in Marikana were also referrred to as criminals

Can someone leak the remaining episodes already?
Yes?No? https://t.co/SAqPsHq6wm
I am tempted to spoil #battleofthebastards for most of yall. But I will relax. By far the best GoT episode I've watched this season
@Supremo0730 *failed to convert*
Draymond Green messed up when he failed those two free throws when they were 3 up I think. That was careless. You don't win rings like that!
@Supremo0730 every basket not converted is giving the ball possession away to the opponent. You can't afford that in tight games.
@Supremo0730 especially when their conversion isn't as nca as they would like it to be. Otherwise you end up giving games away.
What GSW should take from this 4th quarter lose is that in as much as they are a 3 point machine, sometimes they gotta play ball.
Curry was as useless as Love today
What was Steve Kerr thinking by putting on Curry against Irving at such a crucial moment? Not even Barnes? Given tht Iggy n Green wer 4 LBJ?
The mantra of sport finals: \"you need everything to be right for your team at that moment. It doesn't matter how great your season was\"
@SimpleeKatli  I told Lebron's pre-training camp would help the Cavs. Look at Kyrie and Jefferson. Love is an exception

That she has mothered a well mannered son? Or isn't she disappointed in you maybe? https://t.co/hb7fNqsTFa

Your mother will not wake up on a random day, and be mad at you because you left your girlfriend. Never!
 https://t.co/cVa9ua83Wm
Or maybe the boy never told his mom how he really broke up with Zinhle( Cheating and stuff). N she found out elsewhr https://t.co/jYznZjkYXC
Maybe AKA's mom spoke to him about how what he was doing to Zinhle wasn't right. And the boy went on anyway https://t.co/jYznZjkYXC
But you cannot expect your mother to hold you down for cheating someone's child. https://t.co/jYznZjkYXC

Towards local elections! More people are bound to protest to as a sign of how unhappy they are with the govt. Wht a better way to hide this

They will do anything to hide this! https://t.co/Jscnta2FQ9
@Supremo0730 isn't it educational when through #FeesMustFall the public learnt that students cannot get their degrees bcos of historic debt?
Isn't it educational to the public when the public learns that workers are being exploitted and they are underpaid?
@Supremo0730 we are distracted by celebrities
@Supremo0730 educational to the public
@Supremo0730 educational to the public
On a day we are supposed to be asking what does Hlaudi mean when he says SABC will no longer be broadcasting protests as they are not
A mother is a mother! A mother will not endorse your fuckboikery on anyone's child! Period!
Lol jah. Grand sharp! So he blames Zinhle for that. https://t.co/PBNYXPkvGL
Bafethu this is deep. https://t.co/kilsAwFgxe
@Supremo0730 I am not surprised though, the same way in all soapies they always rave our government(an ANC led government).
@Supremo0730 people do not protest to be televised!
In the meantime, the ANC has through SABC reduced the struggles poor black people face as a tool for wanting to be televised

@Supremo0730 Your mother cannot hate you ex-girlfriend because you cheated on her
Who's they? https://t.co/tOLxR00HjV
@Mngxitama very misguided!
Gents, when you've introduced your girlfriend to your family,n they ne hv bonds with her, they will love her even when you stop loving her.
SABC to no longer cover protests. I assume they are doing it  so that no one will be held accountable for Police brutality.

@Supremo0730 I was referring to situations similar to the EFF's situation.
The other day when I said we need to look into the fraustrations that lead people to revolting
@Supremo0730 the state of leadership in this country 
@Supremo0730 mind you that most of these oumas and oupas had come from as far as Eastern Cape
2 weeks ago, when grandmothers and grandfathers were ignored outside Parliament, ANC MPs were playing with Toy Guns inside Parliament
@Supremo0730 surely we are under a toxic leadership.
@Supremo0730 today it is infront of the President himself
Women were manhandled for standing in solidarity with our grandparents like 2 weeks back or so outside Parliament by Police
In the presence of the President, a woman was manhandled! In the presence of the President.
The same tactics deployed in Parly are the the same tactics institutions of higher learning deploy to silence those who challenge the system

@SegoGumZ 
Why though? https://t.co/CxiJWXKtrK
My argument is that people do not revolt to sabotage others.
I am not condoning the burning of buildings or any form of destruction to property.
Revolting is a form of expressing pain.
Because one thing for sure is, we all come to universities in a right state of mind. However, university spaces are suffocating.
Another question you ask is \"if these people have lost their right state of mind, what events have led to this...?\"
I like the fact that most of people will ask \" who in their right state of mind would...?\"
Sometimes we need to look into the fraustrations that lead people to doing what you people label as \"barbaric\"

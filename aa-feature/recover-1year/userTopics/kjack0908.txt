I don't even know why teddy has a cell phone. He never answers it.
I need a hair cut.  #Pronto
Just started crying for no reason.  I hate hormones.
Should be cleaning my house, instead I'm sitting on my butt watching orange is the new black.   #priorities #OITNB
I wish I was cuddled up warm in my bed instead on at work wiping butts.  #NursingProblems #nightshiftprobs
My whole Instagram is pictures of my pets. #loner #crazycatlady
my roots are so long that it looks like I'm going bald. #ugly #needmoney
4 hours of sleep just isn't going to cut it for tonight.  #nightshiftprobs #3rdnightinarow

@natty_p13 alright well I'm free the 23rd through the 26th.  How about then?
@natty_p13 I miss you too!  When can I come down there!?!
When I start to feel lonely, I remember wine is my bff.
Came across my stats teacher on tinder. So tempted to swipe right but I know that'll make class so awkward...
Haven't gotten my hair cut since junior year,  maybe it's about time...
Trying to get the motivation to get out if bed is like trying to get the motivation to kill my dog...it's not gonna happen.
Never thought I'd be so thankful for a fence.
Sleeping is overrated anyway... 
The force of gravity ripping my bun from my scalp is so painful! #heavyhairprobs
Finding a new place to live is soo stressful!
I feel like lately I have to dye my hair once a month.  #rootsonroots #annoying
Please lord do not give me incontinent people tonight. 
Can't wait until I'm 21 and nocturnal!
I can't watch undercover boss without crying like a baby at the end #soemotional
Really hoping my landlord lets me move early 
All I want right now is a Bloody Mary. 
I'm feeling extra bitchy tonight.  #dontjudgeme
Why do people talk so much shit al the time.  Get outta here!
Four hours of sleep just doesn't cut it got a 12 hour shift.  Frick.

I'm not kidding when I say that I work everyday of my life.  Honestly.
@adondzila hey when I get to class I've been awake for 28 hours.
Just came across the guy who's done 99% of my piercings on tinder.  Kinda awkward.

i've worked 72 hours this week.  i'm done.
@jacksonmauraann hey now.  Who do you like more??
it's ironic that the only class I cannot get an electronic book for is my online class.  that's annoying.
I've been asleep since Tuesday morning.  I'm really not kidding.
sick of the same shit everyday.
Literally just slept the whole day.  #woops
Happy birthday natty!  Love you! @natty_p13
Laying around makes me so hungry.
Happy bday Jen!  Love you! @juicyj_en

Dane Cook is just so fucking funny.
That awkward moment, when you and another girl and her baby are the only ones in a waiting room and she just keeps talking to her baby #shhh
Just turned my heat on 
@juicyj_en all I wanna know is sexy can I?
Perfection. http://t.co/jHANtubqJy
@juicyj_en this might be the creepiest thing I've ever seen.  I don't even know why...
Why am I obsessed with gossip girl? 
I just wanna smash this test and go to bed. 
Why is microbiology even a thing... 
It's so weird being in a library alone at this time of night.
@natty_p13 I do too. 
Everyone's pregnant...and I'm just not.  #countingmyblessings
@natty_p13 that's actually so sad.
It's days like today that I miss living in the city.
Why am I so motherly?
I don't even like cats but mine are pretty cute. 
school is my boyfriend.
@natty_p13 love always.
4 hours of sleep just isn't enough.
Well first AA meeting was a success.

My brother answers my FaceTime and goes "What do you want you fucking potato?"
@brtburns42 @molly_pippin I'll be there too
I don't think I've ever been so embarrassed in my life...
While putting on my khakis and polo this morning:Me: wow, I look like a fucking dyke Austin: well that's ok, you can be my dyke

I love how my life is just one big pile of shit
Probably shouldn't have started that conversation
My brothers new thing is to call people dildos
I can tell I'm still drunk because I'm overly obnoxious
Drunk Erika and I are 2 completely different people
@brtburns42 and I have come to the conclusion that we hate our drunk selfs
Woke up next to a popcorn bag and popcorn all over my bed, good job drunk Erika
I wanna take a shower, but at the same time I don't wanna fuck with @aambernicole_  and @_abbyshea salon job
Fuck boys and the rules

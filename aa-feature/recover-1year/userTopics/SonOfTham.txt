@TheRealJerryH Sounds interesting. TV writing was really good fun for us. It's not as arduous as film and stretches you to be drum tight.
@ezekielmechanik Writing is The Grid. It's also top driving music, particularly when you are wearing sunglasses at night. #itsbeendone
@TheRealJerryH Will do. And you do likewise when your new product is ready.
@TheRealJerryH I'm listening to BC2. Jackson and Travolta is unreal. I liked the Statik Selectah tape too.
@TheRealJerryH Agreed. Reading Dead Ball was great for me, will def be sending you our two new ones when they're ready to roll.
@TheRealJerryH That's crazy, I was listening to Blue Chips by @ActionBronson when I was writing on Friday. That shit is SICK.
@TheRealJerryH ...being in draft mode. You can't show anyone or read any of it or talk about it. It's punishment. You walk the line.
@TheRealJerryH I need to become a better reader. I enjoy it, but need to do more. I'm always thinking about our shit. You're right about...
@TheRealJerryH Ah, right. Wicked.
@TheRealJerryH It worked out for the better. Didn't watch any movies. All I did was listen to music. And worked. Like a motherfucker on it.
@TheRealJerryH As regards the other thing you mention, it's too much. I just finished draft 3 of our 3rd script and I read nothing during it
@TheRealJerryH When you say \"my groups\", what do you mean by that, J?
I read lots #scriptchat here. Best advice I can give is: Don't read a thing about script writing in between writing, just finish your draft.

In tribute Moyes not taking MUFC questions, Rolling Stones' next gig will consist entirely of songs from Dirty Work and Bridges To Babylon.

Space permits making that seem less harsh, but the point is that he is not a winner. And that club now demands victory.

In my adult life, I was once thrown out of a pub in Manchester for breakdancing. That is a time I do not recollect quite so fondly.

After listening to 'No Line On The Horizon' for a few weeks now, I'm convinced it's a masterpiece. It's their best album since Achtung Baby.

@KryssaK I guess honestly all you have to watch is the toxins in lotions/sunscreens and then your body over heating! So lay in a pool!
@KryssaK Exactly  I would wait until your first trimester before anything!! But I feel like laying out would be safer, just no sunscreen!!
@KryssaK All that can really hurt the baby is you over heating! My doctor didn't recommend but said sunscreen was 1 https://t.co/ccunCuGsLr
Still don't recommend tanning while pregnant but damn that's crazy!

Most motivating tweet thread I've ever read  https://t.co/iiBAH5jpLt
It's so sad that the people you love can do the most fucked up shit to you &amp; you'll still forgive them bc you don't want to lose them.
You think I need you, but I don't
Kels &amp; I took 4 kids to the movies &amp; honestly the hardest part was trying to play PG music on the way there &amp; back
Kels &amp; I took 4 kids to the movies &amp; honestly the hardest part was trying to play PG music on the way there &amp; back
I'm not sure if I'm proud or upset to say that I'm a white girl that didn't get to try the unicorn frappuccino
A guy just walked out of the tanning bed....completely naked asking how to work the bed.. I think it's time to put my 2 weeks in
@cRio1330 I get motion sickness so I'm not sure how well I'll hold up on a cruise  especially drunk lol
@kearen_MJ All 3 haha idk I'll be 21 so idc about age I kinda care about money but a lot of the trips I found were paid food/drinks
@Walts_Tweets It's seriously not expensive at all!! There are package deals for like under 1,000 dollars!

My whole life did a 360 in a matter of 2 weeks but my heart &amp; mind can't seem to keep up
My life https://t.co/NsgaUeOg93
It's sickening to see the rolls played on social media. Fakes claim to be the realist, dead beats claim to be A1 &amp; negatives play positive.
@Fuller99Macy Happy birthday sweetheart
The waiting game is going to kill me
The next person to tell me how to live my life is getting punched in the face
Trying my best not to act out of character today, but I'm not making any promises.
@kaaymccoy I'll call when I leave my movie
@kaaymccoy Who tf are you so mad at?
Yassss baby girl, yaaasss  https://t.co/jgBeWc2ilR

I have no motivation to beg anyone to stay in my life anymore.. if you want to leave I'll happily show you the way out.
@WolfOfWalnutSt_ Exactly why I referred to them as trash
@WolfOfWalnutSt_ It's a real life thing, people seriously say it
@WolfOfWalnutSt_  I said not to @ me
You are TRASH if you say "come at me when I drop this baby" idc who you are. Don't @ me
@alysiiiiaa happy birthday princess
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life..
I was bitching the other day about being "alone" but reality is.. I ended up with such amazing/supportive people in my life.
It's tan FREE day at Sundown today ladies! I'll be in huber until 5 tonight, come see me
@Combs___ Sorry I was having an emotional breakdown, I love you
It took me 20 years &amp; a life changing event to realize it.. but honestly all I have is myself &amp; I'm gonna be okay with that.
Some girl at mcdonalds just told me I was really gorgeous and she loves my tattoos. I'm half tempted to turn around &amp; ask for her number
@cRio1330 Exactly! Hell, at least wait until you see an ultrasound. All these girls are gonna go to their 1st real https://t.co/jhjwO7vpE5
@cRio1330 It's not even recommended to announce your pregnancy at 2 weeks.. let alone post a picture of your bloated stomach lol
Ugh, I'd do anything to be on a beach rn. https://t.co/XBuq2XVOAK
Why do girls post belly pics when they're only 5 minutes pregnant... your baby is practically invisible.. I promise you aren't "showing"...
I love the friendships where you don't even have to say "please don't tell anyone" bc you know they have your back without asking
Count me out https://t.co/IZDUG6gnGi
Where can I sign up to put my life on a reality TV show bc this shit is getting crazy.

@addie937 tf is a finsta???
@PRobards unless sierra or keili hate you.. then I probably hate you.
I'm not petty enough to hate someone just because my friend hates you.. but how can I trust you to do me right when you do them dirty?
@reckkayla I'm that friend  https://t.co/rDuT1eqfaz
Boy, I thought Nicki was saying she didn't want no "frogs" this whole time &amp; it's frauds
@miraaaaaaanduh sounds like him
There is an inch of water in my basement, HAPPY FUCKING TUESDAY
@addie937 yess!! I love it. I have 35% of ever check go into savings every check and then try to never touch it lol
@addie937 set up your check to have a percentage go into your savings instead of your checking! That's what I did!
I'm just ready to be in Hawaii
@CassiHamlin there is just NO reason to downgrade or throw dirt on the names of people that are supposed to be friends, Yanno? Ruins trust
I used to subtweet bs all the time, so glad I grew out of it  https://t.co/roU4vnEsNS
Yess lmao https://t.co/0LaUCRUJo8
@mayganrenae can I tag along?
I used to be all about second chances, forgiving &amp; forgetting but now I'm too old to have temporary/half ass people in my life.
My throat is practically swollen shut, pretty sure I have an ear infection, my back feels broken &amp; I have no one to take care of me
@Sierrrarose__ don't get emotional on me
@Sierrrarose__ those were half ass, I didn't know if it'd be real or not at the time of the tweet lmao
@WolfOfWalnutSt_ highly doubt my first home will be as big as my moms, but I'm working on it lol
@WolfOfWalnutSt_ momma's haha

I was just bragging about my friends the other night &amp; not a single one of them have called me w plans tonight. Fuck all ya'll.

I don't own any green &amp; the first person to pinch me today is getting dropped.
Omg we have to post that one of all 4!! It was so cute  https://t.co/pC0BVaK72l
@KryssaK I'm gonna be here regardless, and you know that. I guess I'll just handle your drama once you bring it to him.
@KryssaK unless I'm being lied too, I was told that was never said. You know Ryan, don't instigate the situation.
@KryssaK live your life and he'll live his. If your boyfriend says one more thing about chuck, Chanda or Ryan then it will get even uglier.
@KryssaK my ex has said things 10 times worse than Ryan would ever even think about. Ryan isn't the only one bringing family in this.
@KryssaK no one needs put in check, it needs dropped and left alone. Now. You know how many people speak on my name daily? I ignore it.
@KryssaK you're both living two different lives now. No need for you to talk, tweet or think about him. And same for him.
@KryssaK I'm asking you to be grown. Because I know you know how to be.
@KryssaK don't do this
@Aka_yo_boy_wink
Sorry for 2 selfies in one day, but my make up wazzz guuuuddd 2day https://t.co/BsYthRWfv7

@ttmullins13 happy birthday sweetheart!! Hope you stayed out of trouble today
I had my nudes pulled up on my phone &amp; sat it down to help a customer.. totally didn't realize until she said "omg I love those underwear"
Loving someone who doesn't love you and not loving someone who loves you can actually happen &amp; that's heartbreaking to even think of..

@tristyykay it's your life/relationship. As long as he isn't hurting or using you then I'm happy if you are
@tristyykay gotta do what makes you happy baby girl
Not sure how people get divorced after years w kids and everything... I couldn't even handle a break up in high school
@JauntaeBlakely you're perfect, shut up. I love you
One thing I can't stand is when boys bash each other just to look "cool" in front of a female.

I really need to stop trying to save everyone else before I end up trying to find someone to save me.
Life makes better sense after you realize the difference between the temporary and permanent people in your life.

I'm not the type to hate you if my friends hate you, but if you did my friends dirty then how can I trust you not to do me dirty??
Tomorrow is Thanksgiving &amp; I doubt the love of my life will even try to text me, but I'll be cool

I have a high pain tolerance and feel like I'm dying rn so rip to me
I dare anyone to talk down to ben or to talk bad about ben. Together or not, that's my baby &amp; I'd go to war for him. Try me.
I refuse to be with a guy who is extra friendly with every girl he meets.

Warning: don't try and pursue any type of relationship with me bc I'll always end up back with my ex
This is so me  https://t.co/BDK38jlJVn
If you don't stand up for and protect your girl then why are you with her?
All of my ex's called to tell me happy birthday last night &amp; my dumbass answered every single one of them
"Happy birthday.. oh &amp; happy anniversary"
NOT EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE REPEATED.
Why in the hell did I think getting two full time jobs was a good idea

This is what I'm that last text @c_atkinsss01 https://t.co/wa4UDFipXA
Everyone's like "why do you wear make up, you look the same with/without it" well I feel like I look like a 12 yr old little girl w/o it
@kaaymccoy every time I hear "foreign" I think of chase at forest asking "what foreign girl was in your passenger seat?"

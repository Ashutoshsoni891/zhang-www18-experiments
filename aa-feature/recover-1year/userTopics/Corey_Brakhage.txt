That loss was hard. Someone tell me it'll be OK?
I've always said @matt_bryant3 is the real Matty ice on the falcons. He always comes through
Falcons rise up. ..just in case anyone didn't know.

I just want to sleep for a week. Someone wake me up when athfest starts.
@Aimeewinn let me know how bad ass @TNAF is. I would absolutely kill to be there
@Smoking_Runner I will one day just to do it. Plus I'm gonna need the bike anyways since I want to do an ironman to cross off my bucket list
@Smoking_Runner don't got the money for a good one. And besides that was just an exercise bike. Doubt it was that accurate
@Smoking_Runner I remember back when I was injured a lot and I was biking I did 26.2 in 61 minutes. Lol I think cycling is my second sport
@weeeewshayla lol.. They do.
@weeeewshayla it'll probably be good for you then. You'll learn be \"you\" and not your hair lol.
@weeeewshayla lol. Hair will grow back. But it will never grow short..or a different style
@weeeewshayla go big or go home
Go coffee black!
And right now I feel 12 as shit lol
No matter which way my taste evolves I always come back to listening to the pop punk/emo genre. Probably cause it makes me feel 12 again

@Smoking_Runner if it doesnt take like a watermelon jolly rancher then you arent doing it right
@Kayhay12Kh lol jk. everyone is invited. if you really want to come ill send you a facebook invite when we get everything planned.
@Kayhay12Kh the invite list might be full. but ill see what i can do lol
@femaIes @Kayhay12Kh thats what my 21st will look like next month lol
@_australienne lol oh is that what we are calling it these days?  youre all talk and no action.
@_australienne well \n1. fuck you\n2. it wasnt even aimed at me\n3. i doubt we are even talking about the same thing that your first post was
@_australienne lol why would i do that? what makes you think im more likely to respond like this?
@_australienne you couldnt just like DM me or something?
@_australienne why? for who?
@_australienne lol twitter doesnt need to know these kinds of things
@_australienne is it really? lol
today my name is ferris bueller cause i have a flat tire on my bike. so now i got a day off.  who want to party?
im out of ketchup. anyone want to bring over some ketchup?
@luhcreeshuh from the weird part of mytube. https://t.co/o1pBwQYS5M
i cant wait for our 21st birthday party. its going to be ..the best
@dancyndan oh well. im gonna get it anyways. just wait till i have a phone to save it on lol.
@dancyndan no.. should i? lol
i swear when i get me a new phone i will have like 3 or 4 numbers in it. cause thats how much friends i have now days
@_australienne oh.. damn. i was proud of you for a second.
@_australienne i guess im good lol. just being antisocial . you?
@Gerra07 athens\ncome live with cale lol
@molly_larkins it goes down an hour everyday so kids can go out and play 60
@_australienne what?
@MacyHDalton also you might like greek. its kinda girlish but i watched them all anyways lol
@MacyHDalton watch kyle xy. its good but i doubt youre going to like the last episode so be prepared.
@_australienne lol...im not going to bike across ga to do your hair. plus i dont even know how to do hair
if being a douchey clone is what it takes for some guys to have their confidence and cool then thats fine  i guess. its just pathetic
i just wonder how it feels going DT knowing that you are one of 10000\npeople wearing the same shit
cause you know them fags didnt dress that way in highschool
i can just imagine a guy on the first day of college trying to change his whole wardrobe to be cool.
which brings me to another topic....all the fags wearing khaki shorts sperrys and a pin striped polo shirt
half of those chicks are superficial as shit anyways.
that shit just turns me away. idc how cool you could be. just seeing one of the DT clones is a automatic no
i hate all the girls DT. they all look and dress the same. as if that was the formula to get a guy to buy you a drink
@_australienne .....assuming you have tried to send me one lol
@_australienne i just liked the fight scenes with the old lady. ...btw i lost my phone over a week ago so i havent got any of your snapchats
@_australienne its more of a comedy lol.
@dancyndan god yes those smoking ones are fucking weird
@dancyndan like the old spice one?
@ariel20___  needs to stop tweeting?retweeting porn all the time lol. there are children here.
cause you will never die caught up and content if you are trying to make your future self happy with money and a \"succsessful\" life
to hell with all that. live for now. live to be happy. get good friends. enjoy the shit you do have.
unless that happens people are going to die feeling unfulfilled and stressed wondering why they never caught up in life.
people  need to learn that there are more important things in life than money and how \"successful\" your career is
i really wish i could find my damn phone. i bet little gnomes came and stole it in the night.
@luhcreeshuh but everything looks perfect from far away
@dancyndan red power!
i need more friends. like where the hell did all my close friends go to?
Whenever I look back On the best days of my life\nI think I saw them all on T.V.\nI am so homesick now for Someone that I never knew
@luhcreeshuh I like these better. http://t.co/ccq1iJ6zhc
@candiiham I feel ya. When I was in hs I could still shop in the fat kids department when I couldnt find a T-shirt in my size.
@Megan_Reenae turn up! yo nigga gonna be a baby daddy!
I wish everything on my phone looked as awesome as the instagram app.
@Kayhay12Kh they might be bringing him back in a new show
Also.  I'm going to quit tweeting cause I somehow always make a fucking typo. Makes me look dumb.
Plus im glad no one ever knows how to get in touch with me lol. That makes me happy.
I honestly don't think I'm ever going to get my phone me service back on. Its such a useless 35$/month.
@codeybrakhage lol why would you post this pathetic shit?. And why did you run with your phone?
@StephhRenee09 no lol there are tons of indie artist who have different sounds than just \"white boy folk experimental\" .
@StephhRenee09 btw, indie isn't a genre.
@StephhRenee09 what can I say. I got bad taste and music and I fucking love it.lol
@dancyndan @StephhRenee09 I can definitely show you some good ass indie shit.
@StephhRenee09 @dancyndan she can expand them all she wants but country music will still sound like shit. Lol  no point in forcing it
@molly_larkins how you seen the mechanical man? The people in that movie keep having that same dream.
@luhcreeshuh good cause I need a ride.
@StephhRenee09 k
@StephhRenee09 but you don't drink?
@ItsAshlieeee lol you were following me at one point. Either way you're still pretty late.
@ItsAshlieeee I think you're a little late lol.
Went on a junk food binge last night. I feel like shit. It was nasty and I'm still hungry. I'm never eating junk ever again.

Or a slushy.... A slushy would be nice
Damn I am thirsty. Someone bring me a big ass Gatorade
Damn. I really wish I could have gone to PCB again this year. I'm going through \"turn up\" withdrawal.
@randee_bettis hi Brandi&gt;&gt;&gt;
@Gerra07 its a potato... That looks like something else lol
@Gerra07 I'm your best friend right?
The strokes right now&gt;&gt;
@DamniLoveRunnin ain't nobody sleeping bro. Its Friday night.
I swear I'm going to watch Pokemon all day like long. Gotta watch em all. Gotta watch em all, pokemon!
@StephhRenee09 @codeybrakhage k
@randee_bettis Nah Gatorade is just good as fuck
@neiltyson how do I watch it if I'm at work?
@Gerra07 @codeybrakhage I am. I've been to six flags like 15 times lol
@Gerra07 @codeybrakhage oh... That does happen lol. That only happens at fairs.. Roller coasters like these just feel like really fast cars.
@Gerra07 @codeybrakhage most of them don't go backwards lol you'll be fine. If you die we all die together :)
@Gerra07 @codeybrakhage yea... Six flags is better lol. Most of the coasters there are safer though more fun than scary..except Goliath
@Gerra07 @codeybrakhage they're exhilarating as shit lol. Ever been to six flags?
@Gerra07 @codeybrakhage scared of six flags?
@Gerra07 @codeybrakhage lol yea theyre real picky. I just know people... Well my dad does. But yea it pays well also.
@Gerra07 @codeybrakhage Lowes.  I unload trucks. Its great lol jk.  I get weekends off though
@Gerra07 @codeybrakhage I was for a second lol but I need to pay rent somehow right?
@Gerra07 @codeybrakhage yea well.. I work and shit.. And I'm broke. So as soon as I have lots of money and no job I'll let you know lol
@Gerra07 @codeybrakhage maybe. Its just depends. I'll let you know
@Gerra07 @codeybrakhage lol. Yea whenever y'all want to come to athens.
@_australienne like I said I don't know what I'm talking about lol. I'm obviously from a different world
@_australienne you win. That sucks. I obviously don't know what I'm talking about.  at that point you should worry about living. Not health
@_australienne does your mom make less than $1200 a month? Is she single with 2 kids?
@_australienne give me an example of someone in a situation like that who would get approved?... Illegal citizens maybe. Or convicts.
@_australienne they get a donor.. We had a donor or something growing up. Just a shit load of hardly outdated food. Expensive stuff too
@_australienne if you are in that situation you will get approved.. If you can't afford $100 a month in food you are going to get approved.
@_australienne I thought you were talking about food stamps.. Lol but yea.. I've never seen food cheaper than Ramon but still.
@_australienne my mom made more than that and got $400 dollars a month in ebt
@_australienne its hard to spend less than that person unless you really get ONLY Ramon. No I wouldn't be suprised
@_australienne let's be real. If you have two kids and one income source that is an entry level job make min wage.. You will get ebt
@_australienne I said $20-30 per person.. I eat a lot so I'm sure it would cover everyone off of 60-90.
@_australienne $20 per person with a single mother and two kids is $60... Foods stamps easily cover that.
@_australienne yea true... But anyone who has children with a situation like mine is a retard.
@_australienne yea brands will fuck you over.. I stick with the store brand... Unless the store brand absolutely sucks lok
@_australienne I work 25 hours a week at a entry level job with no help from my parents... Unless you from Africa I doubt you're much poorer
@_australienne like I said I only spend like 20-30 every two weeks and I eat no junk.
@_australienne yea I doubt that's even food lol. OK so unhealthy shit is cheaper. But healthy food is still very affordable.
@_australienne oh lol. I would know about that cheap low quality shit. All my food is fresh... BTW a bag of beans is like 1.60.
@_australienne microwave meals are also more than $2 a meal
@_australienne oh junk food?.. Eat a bag of cheaps in one sitting lol how is a$3 bag of chips cheap?
@_australienne so mine last me awhile.. You just gotta know how to shop... Although anything is expensive compared to Ramon lol.
@_australienne I was talking about raw veggies. And just because its package doesn't mean its bad for you..I spend like $20-30 evry 2 weeks
@_australienne most of my meals are 30 cents to $1. So that's pretty cheap...
@_australienne fruit is expensive... But now. Whole grain rice or spaghetti isn't expensive neither is fresh veggies... Or oatmeal.
@_australienne healthy food is affordable you must be thinking about something special.
@StephhRenee09 @luhcreeshuh so whose cunting? Lol
@luhcreeshuh prehistoric republican'ts and their nave granddaughters lol probably
@luhcreeshuh I honestly don't understand why it would ever count. I mean whose keeping count?
Life is to short to have to worry about when to go to sleep. I say fuck it. Stay up till you pass out and let tomorrow you deal with it.

The U never loses power. That's why I moved here bitches
@_australienne its called world of war craft...start playing it
@luhcreeshuh @dancyndan ... @StephhRenee09 is to good to drink.
@codeybrakhage stfu nigga you don't even work there anymore. Let go of the past
Has anyone else heard birdys version of the district sleeps alone tonight? Its not as good as postal service but still pretty fly
@Lindseyy822 lol. If you don't want any judgement you should probably be venting to someone who won't judge.....like a dog..or a turtle
And yes.. I meant to say screen shit. That's just a little easter egg for the people who actually read it lol
I wish they had a way to like snapchats. Besides taking a screen shit. I mean how the hell else are you supposed to show  your appreciation?
I want a new avi and I refuse to take a selfie. Someone needs to take a damn picture of me. .... A good friend would.
And its not like I'm an insomniac. I just feel wide awake at night.
Why do I say up so damn late. Doesn't even matter when or how much I sleep either.
@RyanCanady @TheYoungTurks Athens Georgia!
Little Nicky&gt;
@_australienne didn't think you was. I was just semi sticking up for those people.
@_australienne none of that shit matters. My \"plan\" is to be happy. no amount of money or 'success\" define that.
Leo is constantly a top 5 performer every year. No one else does that. But from what I heard Dallas buyers club had some freak good acting
Just thinking back  at the Oscars. Just because Leo didn't win an Oscar doesn't mean he's isn't good. It just means he's not the best
@PCBFessions she looks like a cougar lol
I wish I had someone to hang out with past midnight. Like...I just want to do shit. Ya know?
DiCaprio doesn't work for the Illuminati so he doesn't get an Oscar.
I used to never watch the Oscars cause I thought all the awards just went to mainstream sell outs... I'm impressed though. I was wrong
Its nice to see they have an animated short film Oscar. Instead  of just giving out awards to a bunch of sell outs
Omg! ET is on!
I fucking love the skittles commercial lol. I wish I had skittles as teeth. I'd get all dem bitches
I don't even know why I like star wars so much.. Any other movie that was this shitty with awful acting I'd easily dismiss.
I swear the more and more I watch star wars the more it starts to look like a cheap porno
Why is raiders of the lost ark and return of the Jedi both playing at the same time... Wtf? How the fuck do I choose?
@autumn_hall oh yea. That sucks. Guess I'll see you at our highschool reunion then lol.
@autumn_hall lol that's hardcore yo. You coming tomorrow night?

@CourtneyyFayee why would that matter?
@CourtneyyFayee reasonable enough.. You gonna get a new one?
@CourtneyyFayee but why?
@CourtneyyFayee where's yo face?
@Gerra07 cause on the inside I a fat depressed person who only thinks about what I'm gong to eat next. Lol.
@Gerra07 I workout cause I'm addicted to the feeling of almost dying lol. I absolutely understand the fat depressed people
@Gerra07 I workout. And still, the only thing I look forward to is eating
I'm getting way to damn excited thinking about how to become a farmer.
I think I want to be a produce farmer. Like honestly I would love that as a career.
I honestly cannot wait till the farmers market comes back around.
I'd much rather come home and throw on my spotify playlist then watch TV.
@britttttschmidt doubt it. That's not how the world works lol
@PCBFessions neither. Just party on the beach/hotela.. Went to la vela last time. Complete waste of money.
'Cause there's one hope, one thing I know is true I would drop all of my lovers just to kick it off with you

I kind of want to go on a midnight walk. If I had a leash for my cats that would be so badass right now
@dancyndan celebrate. You can get better tomorrow
I swear I'm about to fall asleep at 10:30 on a Friday night. Wtf has my life become?. #SaveMe
@dancyndan pull your shit together.
I'm going to break into one of my friends houses and use their shower for an hour and a half.
Fuck my 5 minute long water heater.
I just want a nice long solitary hot shower. Is that to much the fucking ask for?
#tbt to my favorite picture on MySpace lol. I really haven't changed since I was 15 http://t.co/2R3BKKOyNh
@PCBFessions 17-21st. Please tell me y'all will be there?
@AutumnLannen oh. That's awesome. How do I get into that?
@AutumnLannen and Yea I found them a couple of weeks ago. So fucking good
@AutumnLannen really...I would but I don't want to work. I just want to listenTo music and fuck bitches lol
@AutumnLannen you're too damn lucky. Have you heard of portugal, the man?
@AutumnLannen they will be in atl on April 28th or something. I don't got money for bonnaroo lol
You knew the hand of a devil And you Kept us awake with wolves teeth \nSharing different heartbeats in one night
Is this the end \nOr just the start of something really, really beautiful Wrapped up and disguised As something really really ugly?
If I die clutching your photograph don't call me boring it's just cause I like you
I don't need to talk about the world, alright? I just want to sleep with a smile tonight
Let's take this walk, it's long overdue
Let's sit and talk and slow things down Just be our old selves again finally\n Let's take this walk
They say it's never easy when you're 23 And maybe that's a lie and it's just hard as fuck for me
we'll live for the pleasure\nforever and ever\nso wild and wasted
I can't help we grew up too fast  \nmade ends meet with nothing to last
Burn your suit and make me feel whole Weren't we kids in this autumn air \nWanting more with nothing to bear
All of your flaws and all of my flaws, When they have been exhumed We'll see that we need them to be who we are Without them we'd be doomed
When all of your flaws and all of my flaws Are laid out one by one \nThe wonderful part of the mess that we made \nWe pick ourselves undone
You're a slave to the system, \nworking jobs that you hate for that shit you don't need,  It's too bad the world is based on greed
There's no money, there's no possessions,  Only obsession, I don't need that shit
just how deep do you believe?\nWill you bite the hand that feeds?\nWill you chew until it bleeds? \nCan you get up off your knees?
I could have made this work \nbut all I had was The hope that pieces would take shape And we could watch them all fall into place
The spite builds up and it can't get through Passive me aggressive you
As the plans turn into compromise \nThe promises all turn to lies
If there's anyone near when we collide \nWe throw them in the middle\nThey can pick sides
Used to be the one of the rotten ones\n And I liked you for that \nNow you're all gone, got your make-up on And you're not coming back
all the lights went straight to your eyes  it's you and i who will hold out till the morning light
maybe it's your kiss, and your touch  that makes me want you more than love
about to go Ham on twitting song lyrics.  be prepared
I've got nothing left\n It's kind of wonderful 'Cause there's nothing they can take away
Hummus muthafucka!. (How do I make an orgasm face/emoji?)
@StephhRenee09 are we all sick these days?
@candiiham my boi!

@CloEvangeline and if you need any help just message me. I know all the tricks now. :)
@CloEvangeline it might be. Just don't think about it. It started out as temporary for me at first so that made it a lot easier
@CloEvangeline yea it really isn't that hard. I don't even think about meat as food anymore lol.  Give it a try.
@CloEvangeline 4 years. Vegan for the last 4 months though.
@CloEvangeline do it. Feels great. And you'll be saving lots of lives.  :)
\"Man-bear-pig: half man, half bear, half pig\"... Lol how can it be half any of those? Thought half was 50%? #southpark

There was an earthquake. Time time run to Kroger and get some alcohol like all the other disasters
Idk why everyone is talking about a damn earthquake? I just had fart. I don't see what the big fucking deal is.
@codeybrakhage http://t.co/BiGbCoTA4Y
I can't believe most people are retarded enough to believe these people only compete every four years lol.
Haha that use to piss me off about when people talked about track. As if there is no such thing as professional T&amp;f apart from the olympics
I absolutely fucking love the winter Olympics.

@brakhage that's a different topic. I won't assume doping till is actually caught. Although I'm sure most are...in some way atleast
In running you know where you stand.
Time is objective and never lies. Nothing speaks the truth more than winning in a head to head contest. There is no sympathy.
I could never do a sport where the fate of my performance lies in the hands of 3 dick heads opinions.
So you're telling me that when the power goes out I'm not going to be able to tweet about the snow??.  What is life?
@BenLarkins and a skateboarder

@_australienne that usually works for me lol
@StephhRenee09 @dancyndan @luhcreeshuh hey
@Mitchael_Todd @britttttschmidt lmao.
@Mitchael_Todd Haha Nah I like to party to much for that
@britttttschmidt @Mitchael_Todd we like complaining lol. It gives us a common enemy. I'm not going to live in denial either
@britttttschmidt @Mitchael_Todd yea. But I hated the school and the programs they offered. I was just there to run and I didn't do that.
@Mitchael_Todd lol damn wed have to be putting in some real work for that. I'm down
@britttttschmidt @Mitchael_Todd hardly. I was injured my whole first year. And I didn't run my second year.
@Mitchael_Todd if I'm going to go all out I'm going to iten, kenya lol. I'd like to go to Portland too. No altitude but great community
@Mitchael_Todd lol yea and its at altitude. Its an awesome training ground.
@Mitchael_Todd no. He just talks about it every once in a while. Lol he'd have to move to arizona
@britttttschmidt @Mitchael_Todd we can do what we want.we're superstars lol. Plus that place does suck
@Mitchael_Todd the coach bought him a beer lol
@Mitchael_Todd apparently the college mesa in Arizona talked to Codey at nationals and wanted him. They are good too
@Mitchael_Todd lol I wish. If they did I would. But I'm pretty sure D3 schools don't give out athletic scholarships
@Mitchael_Todd also the whole freshman class got good.
@Mitchael_Todd lol.yea. I like coaching myself though. Look up Armstrong Atlantic. I know a kid who went there and got super good
@Mitchael_Todd lol I'm of the opinion all colleges are bullshit. I just want to be on a team without going to school lol
@Mitchael_Todd lol I was thinking about going to Piedmont next year too though lol.
@Mitchael_Todd and if NGTC had all of us wed probably look like 25:45, 26:10, 26:30, 27:30, 27:50, 28:20, 29:10
@Mitchael_Todd Freddy ran a 28:30
@Mitchael_Todd how? Lol if their best guy is a 29 guy he would be like 4th at ngtc. Ngtc also sucks though.
@Mitchael_Todd Piedmont sucks lol

@_australienne lol. Yea cause my swag is to heavy to carry
@_australienne did the definition of lame change? Lol

@_australienne lol. But that's genius of it. How can it be creative if it's just some shit you through together
@_australienne yes it does. Is German. Lol either way. Calling me a savage doesn't even make sense.
@_australienne you probably don't even know how to pronounce my last name lol
@_australienne it doesn't look or sound like a rhyme lol.

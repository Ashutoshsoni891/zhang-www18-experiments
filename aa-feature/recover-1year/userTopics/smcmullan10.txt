@iamjsmithh here's a little update: the body's been there for a month
@iamjsmithh My friend's apartment wreaaaaaked, turns out his neighbour had been dead in his apartment.
There's just something very disconcerting about finding out after what you thought was just the stench of trash, was actually a dead body.
I officially know what a rotting dead human body smells like. \nSomething I definitely could have lived without.
I hate seeing people I care about upset, especially when there's absolutely nothing I can do to help.

@LiquorStoreBar set of keys on a bunny hop lanyard!
Yo it'd be super cool if someone would answer the phone at @LiquorStoreBar so I can not be locked out of my apartment for the weekend. 
Everything written on my shirt from last night is nowhere near legible, except @jennyhendy's signature and \"I love big cock\".
Of course I lost my keys
I love the bunny hop
I want the bar tender right here right now. 
Bunny hop with my girls! #barcrawl

@iamjsmithh and if you don't care, then leave it be lmao. I was just making a point.
@iamjsmithh I didn't say I was offended, I said it was rude generally. But it IS common sense that girls look different without makeup.
@iamjsmithh common sense though
\"We'll be there in 20 min.\" Nope. I was right when I tweeted an hour. #typical
@iamjsmithh you said leading everyone to believe that 24/7, I'm just saying most people realize girls look different without makeup

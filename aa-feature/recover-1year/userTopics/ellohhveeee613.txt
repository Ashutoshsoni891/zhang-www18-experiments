There are going to be so many kids named Aiden in school in about 10 years. You guys have got to quit naming your kids that.
Jason Aldean singing the words \"naked in my bed,\" will always give me goosebumps. 
@EthanPalmerg @RJTheCreator 
Pretty sure the only thing I'm taking away from this relationship is my addiction to Clash of Clans. That's all. 
@taylor_brackens 
I can't even explain how mad I am about you.
Single. 
This ain't love, it's clear to see. But darling, stay with me.
Fuck waitresses that make me clean their tables all night. 
Work work work. 
@MossyOak_Romeo  yessss he understands
Blake Shelton must think the same way I do. Every song with his voice is perfect.
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck my life
Why do you feel like you know anything a out him or the relationship he has with her ?? Gooooawaaayyy. #IllSubtweetForYou
He obviously doesn't understand that this IS an upgrade. #IllSubtweetForYou
I always regret wrestling with Dillan. I forget he does mma and karate and that he can throw me around like a rag doll. #SoManyBruises
\"@HeaIthTip: Truth http://t.co/u1F1gk7kf1\" But God does that look like the most delicious pile of grease everrr
Honestly, I have trust issues in men because of the amount of y'alls boyfriends that try to hit me up. 
Wish my mom would quit putting leftovers in butter containers. I don't want to smell baked beans first thing in the morning. Ever.
If you're going to complain about her, maybe you shouldn't have kept her. Gosh you irritate me.

Wonder what the consequences of a bipolar pathological liar and a manipulative cleptomaniac dating will be...
Pretty much been sitting at my kitchen table for over 30 minutes now trying to decide what to eat. But..twitter. So no decision can be made.
It's going to be a long week, but it's probably a much needed break. 
No one can make me cry,\nMake me laugh,\nMake me smile,\nOr drive me mad like he does.  http://t.co/LMOP4gNvQw
I can party and laugh with just about anyone, but when shit hits the fan, there's only one girl I want by my side.

I sleep like 3 hours and now my body feels perfectly rested and won't go back to sleep. Wtf. I wanted to sleep.
\"@GhettoComedies: TF WRONG WITH WHITE CHICKS  https://t.co/ju7s1rp03d\" 
Why are there 2000 people at Sheetz rn.
The best feelimg, is being half asleep in your bed, having you kiss me goodmorning and tuck me back in when you leave for work. 
Don't make plans with me and then be somewhere else when we are supposed to meet. Just don't make plans with me. 
I swear I eat like 4-6 cups of cookout ice a day.
Sucks to be the one who always messes everything up.
Midnight Madness, but im already half asleep. 
About the time I'm on the verge of giving up on us, you throw that smile at me and I'm lost in you all over again.
As many times as I've packed my bags, I never quite make it to the door.

I didn't leave the house today...and my illegal music collection went from 602 songs to 914. 
Forever the best voice.  http://t.co/tzrwkZKrIN
Music makes me so much happier than people. Period. 
Don't let em say you ain't beautiful. They can all get fucked, just stay true to you.

If Hollywood Undead could come play anywhere within like 10 hours of my house and not in fucking Denmark, that'd be chill.

Cool. I love getting woken up to everyone screaming in the next room. 
Sunday Nights are always amusing to me. My bf &amp; i are usually hungover, and we spend the night with his extremely Christian grandparents.
Apparently if you listen to rock music, you will have tendencies to kill your girlfriend in your basement. His gma is crazy, I swear.
I swear Dillans gma's response to everything is \"You need to be careful, you don't know how dangerous that is!\" 
\"@Things4WhitePpl: PDA http://t.co/KAY3KBLriB\" what the fuuuck

Bitch, ya got a thing for my sloppy seconds ? 
Everytime we say goodbye, it's like I'm losing you again. Oh baby, what do you want, what do you want from me ?
I guess I didn't really want that either.
I think we can all agree than red eyeliner/eyeshadow is scary af and always a bad idea. 
So fucking nervous.

I've been you before, so I really feel nothing but sorry for you. 
Okay sleep now. I think the little crazy girl went to bed, cuz she quit calling my phone. 
@taylorrk24 Shumate will loooove that one 
Well I was asleep but fuck that I suppose. 
Seriously though, calling me at midnight and threatening to actually kill me proves that you're every bit as physco as he said. 
Good God you're dumb.
Weeks with Dillan out of town always suck. One day down, 4 to go. 
There will be dozens of people who take your breath away, but the one who reminds you to breathe is the one you should keep. 
I think my whole life is falling apart right now, and to make things worse, I just might be falling in love. 
Playing DD tonight..
I'm pretty positive that I'm going to sit in bed and read Harry Potter all day.
Here's to 19. 
Say what you will, but I think there really is something to Zodiac Signs. It honestly always makes sense for me.
Can I just say, some y'all attention seeking motherfuckers need to quit uploading snapchat stories of you crying. #NoOneWantToSeeThatShit
So. So. So. Hungover. 
But I, miss you.
I'm just saying, maybe you should quit hashtagging #Forever on y'alls pictures if this is your 3rd boyfriend this month.
I still have to wash two loads of clothes, pack everything for this weekend, and be at Dillan's house around 8am. F.M.L. 
I've never fought with someone so passionately before. I've also never felt like all the fighting was this worth it.
\"@SpeakComedy: WHAT IS THIS &amp; WHY AM I NOT THERE http://t.co/IIPOiLaG1q\" psh and I thought the trampoline park was cool.
Gonna kill my boyfriend for waking me up this early. He better be glad he's all the way in Burlington &amp; i don't have a car. 
My head feels like it's going to split open. 
Hehe the andriod princess emoji is brunette.  #ThereIsAReason
Taking a 5 minute bathroom break. Dgaf.

\"@Lmao: Relationship goals: http://t.co/IzEXXAfAwa\" this the kinda shit my bf would actually send me  
The people you never wanted to fall for are the ones who end up being your greatest weakness.
I get all worked up, and then he wraps me up in his arms and it's like every problem is fixed at once. I love it.
My bad, I have feelings and they get hurt sometimes. I'm not bulletproof sorry. 
Being around family is tough. No smokes, no cussing, no talking about sex, drugs, drinkin or parties. No wonder I've been so quiet.
Done. 
I guess if it doesn't work out, then it doesn't work out. No sense worrying all day ab something I can't change till I get home. 
Been trying to fall asleep for over an hour now. Kinda hard when you feel like you're gonna throw up though. 
Insecurity sucks. 
The longer I'm away from my Boyfriend, the more desperate I get for his text messages, and I hate it and it sucks. 
AA meeting was surprisingly good. 
@ZacchGregory that's where my mom's at now. Haha perks of being 18 
@ZacchGregory haha where they mad ??
What sucks about being down here though is not being able to smoke. At allllll.
On the bright side, I'll be 19 in 13 days 
At my first AA meeting.  I'm not even jk guys. I'm actually at one.

Turn Red Nose on full volume in your headphones when you first wake up. I promise your morning will be better. 
But maybe that's just me
Is it bad that I'm okay with my bf going to a strip club? Like I've thought about this for almost 3 days now, and I'm definitely ok with it.
Opening a Mt. Dew bottle that has water in it is actually one of the most disappointing tastes ever.

I regret nothing 
@amandabynes you're a fucking retard
I miss your laugh
When girls don't like me for no reason 
I love being able to see right through people

@RELATlONSHlP: whenever a girl is wearing a hoodie, she's only wearing a bra underneath. no shirt or tank. always. OH NOW IT'S ACCEPTABLE?
@aparr_96  fuck
If you fuck me over it seriously isn't gonna be pretty for you in the end.

It's crazy how much I've had to grow up in this past year.
Oh and rewarding yourself when you do something well is important, too. 
Everything gets better. Just stay strong and smile every chance you get.
I like those people I can have long ass conversations with about anything &amp; they're not boring
Fuck you.
God help me
I can't stand ignorant people
I really hate being depressed
If you can't make time for me I have no problem cutting you completely off.

Lmfao JJ called me fat
Why am I in Illinois
Wtf is going on
You're graduated, sweetheart. It's time to start acting like an adult &amp; not a drama whore middle schooler.
You really enjoy making people feel like shit about themselves, don't you?
What I would do to just have you back..
No, I'm not going to forgive you. Ever.
It's funny that you're trying to be friends with me again after doing something so incredibly shady.
I don't think anyone could even begin to comprehend how insanely happy I am that my room finally smells amazing and is CLEAN  #ByeBitch
How the fuck do you do this to me 
Have fun being homeless 
You're lucky you have a place to sleep because of me and you're gonna lie to my family about me? Get the fuck out bitch.
\"@TweetLikeGirIs: when bae call you \"princess\"  http://t.co/Max3DKhD8z\". Or nah 
I wish I could talk to my grandma and actually get a response just once. What I would do for one day ..
They could never make me hate you, even thought what you was doing wasn't tasteful
It's a scary thing when you start to like someone, but your ex fucked you up so bad that you don't even feel deserving of something good.
Grow some balls and start respecting yourself. He doesn't give a fuck about you.
You know he just keeps taking you back because he's bored, right?
Today's gonna be a good day 
@HeidiPeterson3 Honey, it's not just you

Fuck love, gimme diamonds
Wow you're just making things worse for yourself  Keep going, it's a great source of entertainment.
Omg if a guy ever patted me on the head I'd be fucking pissed like no bye wtf
So my friend just told me he got head today &amp; she used teeth and he didn't know what to do so he patted her on the head and said \"good job\"
So Danielle informed me that clenching my ass when I walk makes it bigger. Don't look at me while im walking for the time being 
Just got hit on by two drunk guys while walking around Milton lmfao
If you have nothing to contribute to this world besides making it worse, getting fucked up on drugs and selling them, then leave bitch 
Abusing hard drugs isn't \"normal\" or attractive. So happy to say I'm above that shit. And even if I wasn't, I wouldn't glorify it.
Just hoping my mom gets a job far away from here
It'll always be the drugs though won't it 
I wish I could be put first
Someone do something with me tonight I'll even look cute for you

It's crazy how I can close my eyes, let the music take me away, and I'm there again.
Listening to music that takes me back to those exact moments when I was completely in love with you
So proud of myself right now 
Not every guy that talks to you is hitting on you lmao

I've been putting myself first and I guess that's a bad thing.
No matter how much you love them. It's impossible.
Trying to help someone with an addiction while you have your own youre trying to fix just doesn't fucking work.
Fuck Greenhouse and this 70 slide PowerPoint

People judge regardless. People make up what they want about you. It doesn't matter what the facts are. It's life. People suck.
So apparently I wasn't supposed to tweet that bc people will judge me..
So after meeting my psychologist today she basically told me my life and my head is all kinds of fucked up

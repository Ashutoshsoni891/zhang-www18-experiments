For example, Pouya. I wasnt even giving the dude a chance til today. Thats fucked cuz he dope af &amp; i was hatin. \"Southside Slugs\" goes hard.
Opinion or fact? Everyday life question...
Sometimes it takes me a few times/songs hearing an artist for me to like them. That's why second, third, fourth chances are important!!!!

I realized it's very ok to change your mind about something. Just because i say/do something doesnt mean that's how i will feel/act forever.
All i can do is pray and thank him for giving me so many chances
The irony is too real right now. God works in mysterious ways. I have chills wtf.

Then you wont need to move on to worse drugs. Alcohol affects your ability to make good decisions so you may be more likely to try something
You can agree to disagree but i think alcohol is the gateway drug... Not marijuana. If you have a significant relationship with mary jane

@UberFacts: A study concluded that when men are hungry, they crave larger women. Fat girls need lovin too.

Do what makes you happy cuz you never know when your time is up.
No one else's opinion really matters except your own. Just don't be ignorant.
Do what you think is right. Don't let someone else tell you what right and wrong is.
You have your own perception of right and wrong.
You are who you are. And I am who I am.
This is the new American Dream
